        <h1 id="alex-nesterov-cs50-final-project-cs50-discord-stats">Alex Nesterov CS50 Final Project (CS50 Discord Stats)</h1>
<p>Disclaimer: started CS50 course on 17 April 2020, finished on 16 May 2020. (It took me 1 month to compelete the course, while having a bit of regular job and taking a rest now and then). My FB: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lehanest95">link</a></p>
<p>Core features of project:
    <ol>
        <li>Log In / Register / Change Password + pass hash, checks, etc.</li>
        <li>Forms submission to write to research database</li>
        <li>Results of research database are &quot;live&quot; and displayed on /statistics page</li>
        <li>Statistics page also has static images of chart generated by Power BI</li>
        <li>Easter Egg - GOD MODE :-)</li>
        <li>All the data tables are stored in the database</li></ol>
<p>Stack used for the project:
    <ol>
        <li>Flask</li>
        <li>Flask</li><li>Python</li><li>Pandas</li><li>JavaScript (for Charts in statistics)</li><li>CSS</li><li>HTML</li><li>SQL (SQLITE)</li><li>Excel to form extra charts from Discord Data</li>
        <li>Power BI</li>
    </ol></p>
<p>So, basically it's a questionnaire with &quot;stats&quot; functionality and GOD MODE ðŸ˜‚</p>
<h3 id="discord-stats-explained">Discord stats explained</h3>
<p>I had the hypothesis that the channel in which student first posts a message - is the one which student first experienced real troubles solving it. Therefore I did some Excel + Power BI to generate charts presented at /statistics page.</p>
<p>I used open-source tool <a href="https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter">DiscordChatExporter</a> to get multiple CSVs from the official CS50 Discord channel. I then wrote Python code &quot;merge_csv.py&quot; to merge CSVs together and form new file &quot;merged.csv&quot; using Pandas. Then this CSV was imported to SQLITE database for ease of queries and speed.</p>
<h3 id="get-data-from-discord-cs50">GET data from Discord CS50</h3>
<p>You can use <a href="https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter">DiscordChatExporter</a> to get multiple CSVs from the official CS50 Discord channel.</p>
<p>You can then run &quot;merge_csv.py&quot; file to convert it to merged CSV of all files and create database in which it's gonna be automatically imported.</p>
<pre class="sh"><code>python merge_csv.py</code></pre>

<p>Make sure you computer/server/environment has all required modelus listed in &quot;requirements.txt&quot; (IDEs like PyCharm may do it automatically for you). If you run it from CS50 IDE - it has everything installed and works right away.</p>
<p>If you want to run it from your CS50 IDE, do this: Make sure you are in correct directory</p>
<pre class="sh"><code>cd
git clone https://github.com/lehanest95/cs50_final_project.git
cd cs50_final_project
flask run</code></pre>
<h3 id="how-to-run-the-web-app-elsewhere">How to run the Web App elsewhere</h3>
<p>Make sure you are in correct directory</p>
<pre class="sh"><code>git clone https://github.com/lehanest95/cs50_final_project.git
cd cs50_final_project</code></pre>
<p>Run the App =)</p>
<pre class="sh"><code>flask run</code></pre>
<p>If you environment gives error, try this:</p>
<pre class="sh"><code>FLASK_APP=app.py
