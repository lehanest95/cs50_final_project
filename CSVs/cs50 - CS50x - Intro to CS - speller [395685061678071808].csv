Think about this
```int x, y;```

If I was the program, I would do this. 
I would grab two separate containers. I would label on ""x"" and the other ""y"".
When you say
```x = 1;
y = 2;```
I will take the value 1 then put it in the container labelled ""x"". Likewise for 2 and ""y"".
Let's say you type
```x = 1;

I was thinking my starting point could be a hash tables which stores 26 pointers (a-z) - You scan the first character and if that hash is not NULL, it takes us to the next hash table of 26. From here we scan the next character.

If the hash returns a NULL we know we've reached a dead end and that word doesn't exist.

My only concern with this is that the starting table is 26 characters and having a hash table for every single permutation will take away some serious memory.

Any suggestions or opinions on how I should approach this?

Thanks!","",""

`
cd ~/workspaces/pset5/speller
find texts -type f -exec ./speller {} \; > all.log
`

will hopefully create a file called `all.log` with all your tests in it.

another approach would be to make a copy of speller.c , call it tester.c, add it to your Makefile, and then change that so that it tests all the files , you could then get a total at the end , and then also do some analysis of your data structure to see how well your hashing strategy performed: e.g.

Is it possible to initialise a structure in c with a variable for the size of an array?

Something like this 
```C
typedef struct nodeWord (size_of_array)
{
    char restOfWord[size_of_array];
    struct nodeWord *nextWord;
}
nodeWord;
```","",""
"210178498378072064","Atom Heart#5790","17-May-18 10:53 PM","Yup. First you have to make `restOfWord` a char pointer:
```typedef struct nodeWord
{
    char *restOfWord;
    struct nodeWord *nextWord;
}
nodeWord;```
Now when you allocate memory for your struct, you get space only for those two pointers, so you can use malloc again, in order to allocate a chunk of memory of fitting size for your string and save the pointer to that chunk in `restOfWord`. Remember to add 1 extra byte for nul-character.

I hope that's clear enough.","",""

So in that respect, it's a constant-time lookup.  But a good hash table (where there are no collisions) will also be in this situation, because it may take only one comparison.  But there's also the physical time (which we don't really talk about) ... a trie (in the context of pset5's spec) will take a lot more memory, and the act of traversing that memory is physically slower when you have more of it.  So the algorithm may have a quicker runtime theoretically, but not in reality.","",""

So if you are storing one byte as a signed number, you have only 7 bits to hold a value, meaning your range of values is -128 to 127. An unsigned number doesn't treat the most significant bit as a sign so all 8 bits are used to hold the value. An unsigned byte has a range of 0 to 255.

I believe by default, almost all languages imply `signed` unless you use the `unsigned` keyword.

In short, it shifts the range of values the variable can take from positive and negative to twice as many positive numbers (generally).","",""

I would still be scratching my head if I hadn't read up on bitwise operators this morning. It took me a while, but I think I see how it works. Since 32 has a 1 in the bit position for 32 and zeroes everywhere else, the XOR will add 32 to a number that has a 0 there (which includes all the uppercase letters), and leave it alone if there's a 1 there, which all lowercase letters will have, right?

2. Once my code is compiled how can i actually test whether it does actually work without the other functions. i.e how would i test this code in a sandbox?

In the speller/load walkthrough, at 6:27 Z sets node1->next=node2 to signify that the next pointer of node1 points to node2. At 9:11 she has now_node->next = head , to signify that the next pointer of new_node is equal to the pointer of head. But this doesnt make any sense. Shouldnt new_node->next=head be equivalent to setting the next pointer of new_node to point to head? or that  node1->next=node2 sets the next pointer of node1 equal to the next pointer of node2, so node1 is actually pointing to NULL. There seems to be a contradiction here how can the same function(=) do two totally different things?","",""

I use this variable to count the number of words in the load function for return in the size function.

So in that respect, it's a constant-time lookup.  But a good hash table (where there are no collisions) will also be in this situation, because it may take only one comparison.  But there's also the physical time (which we don't really talk about) ... a trie (in the context of pset4's spec) will take a lot more memory, and the act of traversing that memory is physically slower when you have more of it.  So the algorithm may have a quicker runtime theoretically, but not in reality.","","üëç (1)"

get the char
c == 'i'
index == 0
first `if` is true, so `word[0] == 'i'` and index is now 1
index is not > LENGTH.   
Since the first if was true, we skip the `else if` and that first time around the loop finishes
get the char
c == 't'
index == 1
first  `if` is true, so `word[1] == 't'` and `index` is now 2
index is not > LENGTH.   
Since the first if was true, we skip the `else if` and that second time around the loop finishes
get the char
c == apostrophe
index == 2
`if` is true, so word[2] == '\''  (apostrophe) and index is now 3
loop around again
get the char
c == 's'
index == 3
`if` is true, so word[3] == 's'  and index is now 4
loop around again
get the char
c == ' '  (space)
index == 4
c is NOT alpha or an apostrophe so move down to
else if  (index > 0)
index is greater than 0, so `word[4] == '\0'` (ie, null char)
words++  (increase word count)
check the spelling, print if mispelled.
reset index to 0.
loop again
get the char
c == 'm'
index == 0

Working through it in my head something doesn't make sense. If I were to follow the walkthrough and go to the furthest point in a trie (not even sure how yet), and I free each nodes children on the way back, wouldn't that orphan nodes that branched off at earlier locations in the trie? i.e. if I unloaded ""father"" what happens to the ""e"" node created for ""fate?""","",""
"393854278764068875","curiouskiwi#1671","10-Jun-19 10:14 AM","let's say you have a trie with just one branch  
`root->a->n->d->null`   you want to unload all the children at the very end and then move back up until you hit the root.  So your recursive function will be called on root by your main unload function.  You'll then check, in a loop, all 27 children of root to see if they have a node.  In this case, you find a node at children[0].  You move your cursor to children[0] and then call your recursive function on children[0].  So now you're running a loop on all children of children[0] and you find a node at children[13] (the 'n'), so you move your cursor to children[13] and call the function again on that node; now you run your loop and you find a node at children[3] ('d').  So you move your cursor to children[3] and you call your recursive function on that node.  You run the loop over all 27 children of that node, but they are all null.  Since they are all null, you then free that node.  That instance of the recursive function is now finished, so it comes off the stack and now we're back into the 'n' call.  It finds no more nodes, so it frees that node, and now that comes off the stack, and we're back to the 'a' call.  There are no more nodes, so it frees that node, function comes off stack, and we're back to our original call to the function on the root.  there are no more nodes, so it frees that node (the root) and you've there are no more 'pending' stacks for the function, so it ends and returns to the `unload` function that initially called it.","","üëå (1)"

You could also implement `size` in a way you would actually count (which is slow, so for speed you would just return the number of words that passed `load`). You could check whether a particular word that you know must be there exists, for example if you had a trie, some code at the end of `load`
```c
if (!root->children[2])
    printf(""missing node for \""c\""\n"");
else if (!root->children[2]->children[0])

Unload is called after count is called in speller.c so if I try to implement count as part of the unload fuction, it is likely that speller.c is going to throw an error because it will try to call count, which would rely on calling the unload function first.

If I instead make count part of the load function, I can count words as I am setting up the dictionary, thus saving the need to traverse the entire dictionary just to count the number of valid words.

Is this the right idea?","",""

So your unload function calls your helper recursive function (let's call that `unloader`) on the root.  `unloader` then loops over from 0 to ALPHA and checks if the node (let's call it `n`) 's children[i] is null or not. In our example, n->children[0] is not null so we now call unloader on n->children[0].   (n->children[0] now becomes `n` in that call).  So we check n->children[i] in a loop and the only one we find is n->children[19]  (the 't') so we then call unloader on that node.  We loop over all the children of that children[19] and they are all null, so the loop ends and we free that node.  Now, the function 'unwinds' back to where it left off (ie, we remove that from the stack) and it eventually gets to the end of all the children[0] and that loop ends so we free children[0]  and then we remove that from the stack and we are left with now checking all the other children of the root, there are none, so the loop ends and we free the root, and everything is now freed.

Further optimizations would mean changing the way the dictionary is read. Now I understand that the starting code is a way to help, but also in some way a distraction that might make you assume you only have to optimize the code you add. But indeed, you have other things to optimize in dictionary.c

Or having a function check which children exist, where checking it when you need to would be much easier to read.
You open the large dict in `size`? This will report the wrong size. Either walk your data structure to count the words, or even easier, store the words you read in a global variable, and return that one.
I don't like how you use `% 97` when you mean `- 97`, or more explicitly `- 'a'`.
As you already factored that out into its own function, you could have used `initialises_children` on `root`. But it does not set `is_word` to `false`, potentially leading to erroneously ""found"" words. `valgrind` will be not amused.
Still haven't found why it would not print the words.","",""

My first instinct was that i can store the address like: `void *nodeblock = malloc(sizeof(node) * 143091)` to get a continuous chunk of memory, but I couldn't figure out how to assign newnodes to each piece of that space. I thought maybe I can manually assign the addresses like `node *newnode = nodeblock + (i * (/* a number corresponding to the size of a node that would displace the address to the new location */)` where i is being incremented for each word loaded one by one. I couldn't get that to work, because I couldn't figure out what to replace the comment with, so I thought along another line.

What if I dynamically allocated memory for an array that stored node structs, with the size of the large dictionary? Then I could assign each node *newnode iteratively to nodearray[i], and in unload()  could free up the entire array all at once. I have not been able to compile this method in any way, so either it doesn't work like I think or I'm not implementing it right. 

Am I close with either of these approaches? Is there another consideration/hint that would help me on my way, @staff?","",""

One thing I can't wrap my head around is, how do I define what character each node represents? (letter of the alphabet plus the apostrophe). Is it as simple as designing the struct of a node as follows: that way I can access the charactor via `node->character ?`

```
typedef struct node
{
    char character;
    bool is_word;
    struct node *children[N];
}
node;

Each node has 27 children, representing 26 letters of the alphabet plus the apostrophe. When writing the code to fill the Trie, you first convert a-z to 1-26 and assign 27 to the apostrophe. Now, when `node->children[i]` returns false, where i is a number that represents a-z or the apostrophe, you know the letter does not (yet) exists in the node you're accessing. 

Hope this helps / makes sense. While I now understand the concept, I still find it hard to explain it.","",""

```C
// Initialize trie
    root = malloc(sizeof(node));
    if (root == NULL)
    {
        return false;
    }
    root->is_word = false;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    {
        root->children[i] = NULL;
    }```
So Iater in the load function, I wrote this:
```C
while (fscanf(file, ""%s"", word) != EOF)
    {
        // traverse trie
        node *trav = root;
        for (int i = 0; i < LENGTH + 1; i++)
        {
            // convert characters of word into an index
            [...]

            // create new node if current index is empty
            if (trav->children[index] == NULL)
            {
                trav->children[index] = malloc(sizeof(node));
                if (trav->children[index] == NULL)
                {
                    return false;
                }
            }
            trav = trav->children[index];
        }```
Yet I'm getting a memory error, something along the lines of `trav->children[index]` not being initialized. But how is it not when `root->children[i]` has already been initialized, and `trav` is merely pointing to whatever `root` is?","",""

"676463066942144512","drail159#6376","16-Feb-20 01:45 AM","@aimlezz Here is my solution to testing the load function on your own:

I created a file called dictionary_test.c:
```
#include ""dictionary.h""
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Default dictionary
#define DICTIONARY ""dictionaries/large""

void test_load(char *dictionary, int words_expected);

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    if (argc < 2 || argc > 3)
    {
        printf(""usage: ./dictionary_test [OPTIONAL:dictionary] [MANDATORY:expected word count]\n"");
        return 1;
    }

    // Determine dictionary to use
    char *dictionary = (argc == 3) ? argv[1] : DICTIONARY;

    test_load(dictionary, (argc == 3) ? atoi(argv[2]) : atoi(argv[1]));

    return 0;
}

void test_load(char *dictionary, int words_expected)
{

    if (load(dictionary))
    {
        int words_found = get_word_count();

        if (words_found == words_expected)
        {
            printf(""PASSED: %i words loaded into dictionary successfully\n"", words_expected);
        }
        else
        {
            printf(""FAILED: %i words expected but found %i words\n"", words_expected, words_found);
        }
    }
    else
    {
        printf(""FAILED: could not load dictionary (%s)\n"", dictionary);
    }
}
```","","üëç (1)"
"676463066942144512","drail159#6376","16-Feb-20 01:45 AM","I also added a function to dictionary.c:
```
int get_word_count(void)
{
    return wordCount;
}
```

Remember to decalre this function in dictionary.h. Just add:
```
int get_word_count(void);
```

then in the make file I added this section of code to compile the whole thing:
```
dictionary_test:
    clang -ggdb3 -O0 -Qunused-arguments -std=c11 -Wall -Werror -Wextra -Wno-sign-compare -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-unused-variable -Wshadow -c -o dictionary_test.o dictionary_test.c
    clang -ggdb3 -O0 -Qunused-arguments -std=c11 -Wall -Werror -Wextra -Wno-sign-compare -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-unused-variable -Wshadow -c -o dictionary.o dictionary.c
    clang -ggdb3 -O0 -Qunused-arguments -std=c11 -Wall -Werror -Wextra -Wno-sign-compare -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-unused-variable -Wshadow -o dictionary_test dictionary_test.o dictionary.o -lm
```

Then you can build with:
`~/pset5/speller/ $ make dictionary_test`

and run the tests with:
```
~/pset5/speller/ $ ./dictionary_test 143091
or
~/pset5/speller/ $ ./dictionary_test dictionaries/large 143091
or
~/pset5/speller/ $ ./dictionary_test dictionaries/small 2
```

You could modify this structure to test any part of the code that you like in any way that you like.
That all said, the unit test that are implemented by check50 should be plenty sufficient. This was fun though. Just make sure that you remove the extra lines in the Makefile before you submit.","",""

After ensuring the capacity is fine, you would write your node into `nodes[node_count]`, and increment the count. That way, `unload` would be a single `free`. Note that with this design, you may not use pointers to reference single nodes in the list, as `realloc` might move them around.

Which kind of resources do you think of?

What you do next totally depends on what you want, and what you need for that. I would try to learn with projects, or that's how I learnt stuff. Think of some small project (like your final project in this course), and learn what you likely need for it, while you build the project. It's not super important the project turns out as you wanted, but you probably learnt, even if you learnt that you totally messed up the design.
Courses with a lot of user interaction (quizzes, projects where there's more than to just add a single line here and there) are also good. Just the Udemy ""who has the most video hours"" principle does not work so good, at least not if the course is all video.","",""

I compared the speed of my solution vs the staff solution on Tolstoy text and mine was about 4 to 5 times slower.
My hash table had 1000 entries which were singly-linked-lists.
When I increased N to 65000 for instance (so 65000 entries in my hash table), then I got the same run time as the staff solution.
If I increase it even more (to 120 000 for instance) then the run time gets very low, but I am questioning the memory usage.

Now I want to use better hash function. I see some resources are provided in the pinned messages. And I found what's called murmurhash. I google a little bit. I found a github repo which implements murmurhash with C. https://github.com/jwerle/murmurhash.c
But I only vaguely understand it. The signature is `uint32_t hash(key, lengthOfKey, seed)`.
My questions are...
1) What is seed? Is it the number of buckets (the size of tables)?
2) It returns hexadecimal digits. How can I use this as index of table array?

And an `if` runs zero or one times, you could unload at most one node per linked list. Any structure you know that runs as long as there are nodes left to free in that linked list?","",""

Weirdly, I fixed an unrelated issue (just added the size() function) and now there are no bytes of memory being leaked. However, I still find this quite interesting. Do you (or anyone) get what's going on here? It's OK if everyone is busy! 

My nodes for the hash table have been initialised using malloc(sizeof(node)). Now, in the unload() function, I am creating a traversing pointer to free each node:

node *trv = table[i];

Then when I am freeing the memory, an example would be freeing a list where there are two nodes in the hash table). When I go through debug50, the information stored at each time/location would be something like this: 

table[0] = 0x6044e0 (address of the node in this line of the hash table). 
trv therefore also points to 0x6044e0
(*trv).word = cat 
(*trv).next = 0x604540 (the location of the second / final node stored under this hash). 

So I create a temp pointer to ensure i don't lose data; 
node *tmp = (*trv).next;

so tmp now points to 0x604540, and debug50 shows: 
(*tmp).word = caterpillar
(*tmp).next = 0x00 (NULL).

When I call free(trv), it removes the ""cat"" and replaces it with garbage. However, the value of 0x604540 still remains in the  (*trv).next . Is this a memory leak? Do I need to worry about this? I feel like it shouldn't happen, and the (*trv).next should be replaced with garbage too. 

As I said, my code doesn't show memory leakage, when I run Valgrind. It was only something I noticed in debug50, and while I'd like to understand what's going on, I also appreciate that your time is precious, so the forum can treat this message as ""a nice aside"" rather than ""heeeeeelp!?""","",""
"361235692019384323","Sanath#7244","27-Mar-20 12:34 PM","only thing thats guaranteed when you free memory is that you dont have access to it anymore, nothing might change in the block, or the OS might give it out to some other program.

I was doing a pset5 speller and encountered a particular issue - segfault. Even though I re-written the code multiple times. Still to this moment the program prompts an error. Could someone give me a hint on where I've might have done something bad? It seems that it loads the dictionary and afterward something hits the fan. I really appreciate any comments/hints and also love CS50 course!

I'm short before submitting my files. But as I look through this chat, I see more and more mistakes in my code:
I mallocd 2 nodes in unload and 1 node in check and 1 in load. According to this chat, mallocs in load and unload are necessary.
The only mistake in my code is, that I don't free the mallocs, but everytime I type in free, the error message comes 'double free or corruption'
Where is my wrong thought?

||So the 2 nodes in unload are traversing through the hash table, one's the cursor and one's the temp (as in the video)
The node in check is traversing through the table[hash_value]
The node in load is for a new word.||

Any help is appreciated! I'm hanging with that problem since 5 hours üòÖ","",""

1. Is a hash table, itself, an array? Meaning for a spell checker would it be ""normal"" to hard code an array with 26 elements (not trying to get an answer directly just a concept)?  And then after you have an array built, you then would create a linked-list for each element in the array, with the root of the array being the array index?

So far in the ""load"" function I have opened the dictionary, read each word from the dictionary, and copied it to a node. Question:
2. When writing to a hash table do you read a word, call the hash function, write it to a node, then use the return value from the hash to write the node to the array?  In that order?  

3. To be clear, the hash table itself is NOT a linked-list...or else you would not be able to index into it, correct?

thanks for your help","",""

quick follow up question: Is creating the hash table something that is done on the fly?  Meaning, do I create the table as I go, or do I read the data into a file then look at it and make a determination?  Because I'm thinking if I look at the words and say I have 5000 words that begin with ""A"" I would maybe want to break that up into many linked-lists.

Is it after, say a function that uses ""malloc"" or within the function or at the end of your code. Sometimes I see a kind of forloop when freeing memory like David did in the lecture. I need a little clarification on that please","",""
"698673555885522996","Omi2006#7359","14-Apr-20 10:58 PM","So when you use malloc, a small portion of memory is given for you to work on. Once you finish with that memory, you no longer need it, so you ""free"" it, or rather make it empty again so that it can be used again in the future. Therefore, freeing memory is just removing its contents, much like removing stuff from a box so that you can store other things in it.","",""

I'm having a hard time understanding the speller problem. I looked at it, started a bit but it just seems overwhelming for me. I've managed to complete everything else in this course so it's only this problem that remain but I'm not sure how to proceed. I hope someone could support me, it would be much appreciated.

Capitalization aside, your implementation of check should only return true for words actually in dictionary.

In other words, even if foo is in dictionary, check should return false given foo's if foo's is not also in dictionary.

so the condition in the while loop is uninitialised 
one way to fix would be to manually set next to NULL when you malloc yourself a new node","","‚ù§Ô∏è (1)"

I believe it was getting a segmentation fault which I fixed by having it simply point to table[index]. However, when I test my code now, the first word in each index is somehow either ignored or overwritten. I'm not sure what I'm missing but that's what I'll be working on today.

Other than that, my char w is [LENGTH + 1] and I'm pretty sure you need to be using scanf before you send w to be hashed. It looks like you're out of order but maybe I'm missing something.","",""

I've decided to go with a simple hashing algo which basically looks at the first letter of the word and put it into a bucket based on that. So a = 0 and z would equal 25. If N = 25 (26 buckets, each representing a letter of the alphabet)  why does my hashing algo need to return a value which is N-1? In my case the letter z would equal 25 and would not equate to the n-1 limit. But I feel this is ok unless I'm missing something?","",""

So my thinking is that the array is an array of nodes. based on this line of code: node *table[N]; However no memory has been allocated no nodes and the nodes have no values. So my thinking is to populate the nodes in the array with the ""header values"" and next pointer which equal Null. For context I've gone for an array of 26 buckets, each bucket representing a letter of the alphabet ie 0 = a, 1 = b, etc. Whats a little weird is that the word value in the node expects a string, but my hash function is returning an int. So I'm doing a lot of casing, doesnt feel right but kinda works.
@Graeme Welp turns out this is the wrong way. I found this video on youtube of a guy doing a demo of how to implement a hash table as well as insert new node, search node and delete node. Helped me out tons. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJbDwpSdGkM","",""

can i ask for the community's help with something?

i've been trying to implement the ""search for element"" function, shown in the ""Singly-Linked List"" video.
when compiling the code, i get an error, but i can't figure out what i'm doing wrong.

The error:
`singlyLinkedLists.c:58:22: error: comparison between pointer and integer ('int' and 'void *') [-Werror]
    while (trav->val != NULL)`

...And the code snippet:
`// func to search for element in the list
bool find(sllnode* head, int val)
{
    // create temp pointer, leading to head
    sllnode* trav = head;
    while (trav->val != NULL)

"278430998931308544","TheElephant#5248","11-May-20 05:37 AM","@curiouskiwi well, considering i shouldnt care for capital\not when checking the words. i was thinking i should just load stuff in as capital\non capital to avoid it later.
same thing with checking them later. what if i, instead of checking a given string against each entry of an array, check it against jumps of word values.
as in convert each char in a given word into capital. do -64. using ASCII values. then for the second char do *26. third *26 *26 ect ect. and that would give me an a value unique to that word. then using something like merge sort i should be able to see how many ""next"" i would have to go trow. go one back. check against that. then repeat.
now i do get that this overcomplicates things and most likely takes alot more CPU power. but it should be better on very large scale no?
tho i might be overthinking when trying to conceptualize this... as it wont help on the scale of 10000 but it should on more i think","",""
