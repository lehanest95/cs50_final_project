// For second half of image, take information from tempArray
        for (int j = 0; j > width / 2; j++)```  this seems wrong.     I might suggest you've overcomplicated it a bit.  How about just iterating over the original image, swapping the first half of pixels on each line with the second half and storing those in a temp array (full size)?  then at the end, copy the entire temp back to the original.

I mean, if you have

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

then you can swap  1  and 8, 2 and 7, 3 and 6, 4 and 5  to end up with

8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1","",""

void swap(int *a, int *b)
{
    int tmp = *a;
    *a = *b;
    *b = tmp;

"393854278764068875","curiouskiwi#1671","07-Jan-20 02:18 AM","it's a bit of a trick.  It's declaring an array of pointers to RGBTRIPLE (ie pixels) but then allocating enough space to hold `height` number of `width` rows of pixels.  By declaring it as an array, you can later read into the row using a loop and bracket notation.  ```C
    // Iterate over infile's scanlines
    for (int i = 0; i < height; i++)
    {
        // Read row into pixel array
        fread(image[i], sizeof(RGBTRIPLE), width, inptr);

Your calloc will allocate 48 bytes of memory and return the address of the first byte in that memory.  When you then `fread(image[0], ...)` the 12 bytes from the file will be stored at that address.  Then `fread(image[1], ...)` will, because of pointer arithmetic, be put into the 13th slot of the memory, etc. until the loop finishes and you've put all 16 pixels into the array.","",""

Point taken.  We were trying to be flexible but I think the flexibility may have caught folks unaware.  Hoping that this FAQ upfront will make it clearer come next year:  

> **I won’t be able to finish the course before 31 December 2020. What will happen?**
> After 31 December 2020, the course will be updated to a 2021 version. Your progress from 2020 will be carried forward to the 2021 version. We will (in 2021) attempt to give credit for as much of the 2021 course as is practicable, so you will not have to start from the beginning.
> 
> That said, the course does change from year to year, and some problem sets may not map from the 2020 course into the 2021 course, which may require you to double back to past assignments. For example, Problem Set 3 in CS50x 2020 has no mapping to any assignment in CS50x 2019, so students who did not finish CS50x 2019 must now complete the CS50x 2020 version of Problem Set 3, even though this may mean doubling back.
> 
> After 31 December 2020, you may only submit the 2021 version’s problem sets and will need to satisfy whatever requirements are in place for CS50x 2021.

Long story short, I was trying to allocate memory to create a temp array that would copy the updated pixel colour values, so I wrote the statement like this : 

RGBTRIPLE *temp = malloc(height * width * sizeof(RGBTRIPLE));

When I tried to feed values in, like :
temp[x][y] = some_value;

it would tell me i couldn't do this because temp[x][y] wasn't an array, pointer or vector. I literally copied the code showed from lecture so I'm not sure why it doesn't work like this. Poking through the rest of the source code, I found that filter.c uses this formula :

RGBTRIPLE(*image)[width] = calloc(height, width * sizeof(RGBTRIPLE));

If you consider the logic going on in your loop, what you are doing is taking the pixel at image[i][j] and simply replacing it with image[i][(width - 1) - j]. But you are not ever actually doing anything with the original pixel image[i][j].  You are overwriting that pixel’s data without ever actually moving that pixel...

RGBTRIPLE(*image)[width] = calloc(height, width * sizeof(RGBTRIPLE));

I understand that calloc will return a pointer to a chunk of ""height x width x sizeof(RGBTRIPLE)"" initialized bytes.
What I don't understand is the RGBTRIPLE(*image)[width]part. Does it mean that image is a pointer to an array of *width* RGBTRIPLEs?

I'm doing a small program to continue brushing up on my skills while my roommates catch up and i've hit a bit of a snag

I'm taking a string in and splitting into multiple parts and adding those pointers to a char * array called args

I'm trying to iterate through args and strcmp them with a known set of operators (a char array that looks like so {""+"",""-"",""/"",""*""}) 

Which works, however I'm stuck where i've initialized args to a specific size (lets' say 10) and I am iterating too far through the array, as I may only have 3 or 4 strings

I do keep track of a 'commandCount' variable which tells me how many strings are split and I can use that to power my for loop, however is there a better way? Maybe dynamically increase the size of args[] with each added string? 

Or is it better to just cap off the iteration so I don't go into my garbage uninitialized portions of the array?","",""

I thought about setting all portions of args to NULL beforehand and doing a loop and incrementing a variable for each non NULL element in args, but that also seems a bit clunky, and I can't figure out how to assign the individual values all at once like when you initialize a char array for example (like going args[10] = NULL;)","",""

Trying to write a more compact solution (not sure if the whole premise of my design even makes sense...), but I'm getting some really weird behaviour inside my for loops (line 129 onwards). Starting at h = 1, w = 1 the first loop through works: it evaluates the corner ""if"" condition as true (line 137), calculates averages and comes back through to the top of the for loop correctly. Then for h = 1, w = 2, things get weird. It checks the if condition for corners and doesn't evaluate it as true (line 137). But then when I click to step through to my edge check condition ""else if..."" on line 150, h suddenly resets itself to 0 (although w keeps its correct value as 2). 

This reset ruins the program and triggers some runtime errors and other apocalyptic sounding errors, but I think it all stems from this weird little reset.

In the same way that `char *` can be thought of as a whole string since it points to the first character of a string, from which we can get to the other characters; `image` here can be thought of as a pointer to the first row of an image, from which we can get to the other rows.

`calloc` is how we allocate enough memory for all of that: we need `height * width * sizeof(RGBTRIPLE)` bytes to store the memory for each of the `height * width` pixels, and using `calloc` instead of `malloc` sets all of those bytes to `0` by default.","",""

For example, instead of using the if (ar > 255) part all over the place, why not write a function that would round and check the upper boundery that later can be used for everything. Also instead of creating all the special cases with similar code, you could try to put this into sub-loops (i.e. for each pixel loop all the neighbouring pixels. If some condition is met in the corners, ""continue"" loop without using the pixels value for the average)
Checking the code you already have, I don't think you can do afterimage[0][0].rgbtRed = ar, because ar is defined as double whereas RGBTRIPLE expects int. Anyhow after your rounding you haven an int.","",""

2. For calculation of edges and corner, I can't use 9 to divide the sum and find the average as the pixel count changes. I can use a ``count`` var and then divide the sum by that, but where do I initialize that counter in my program?

void grayscale(int height, int width, RGBTRIPLE image[height][width])

```

Probably a dumb question but I don't really understand the difference between the **""Height"" ""width""** the the 2d array **""RGBTRIPLE[][]""** arguments we're working with too. 

Like I get conceptually that:

- An image is a bitmap, comprised of a 2d array of memory addresses. 
- I'm probably going to have to use a nested loop somehow to loop through every bit/pixel from start to end, modifying it's RGB value to somehow make the whole image grey 

I just don't know:

1.  How do I make sure the red, green, and blue values are all set to the same value across every pixel (as I imagine each pixel in a complex image is going to have a stupid high amount of variety here). 

2. How do I know what value to make them?","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/637500143385444373/702307315071582249/unknown.png",""

I am not sure whether I am thinking in the right direction. . Step 1) Creating a copy of the image to work with. Step 2) I am trying to look at the middle pixels of my copy image. (so move i from i > 0 to i < (height -1) as well as j > 0 to j < (width -1)). Step 3) I try multiply Gx with middle pixels as well as Gy with middle pixels for each R,G & B. Step 4) compute square root (square(Gx) +square (Gy)). Step 5) Cap to 255. step 6) transfer copy image to original image.  The second question is related to borders and edges. I am failing to understand what happens at the the corners and edges.I don't understand how can Gx multiply with edges. (The walkthrough says treat pixel past the border as zero values).

First time writing here, been having a lot of fun with the course over the last two weeks, but now I might need some help 😅 

I've been looking over the less version of filter and I dont feel very sure about how to... edit the pixels so to speak. 
I get that the top left pixel of the image for example is image[0][0], but how do i assign new RGB values to that pixel? Or even access that pixels information? 
Looking over in bmp.h I get that RGBTRIPLE is a struct containing variables to hold values representing R G and B, but Im assuming that if I tell the computer ""image[0][0] = 0x01, 0x02, 0x03"" it wont just... figure out where to put each value. So how do I tell the computer which value I want to modify? 

""image[0][0] = (rgbtBlue = 0x01), (rgbtGreen = 0x02), (rgbtRed = 0x03)""?
I feel like that would not work 🤔  

Does this thought train of a message make sense? 😅","",""

@TheCredibleHulk Yeh, can take a look. Remember for the corners you need to check both height and column (both h - 1 and c -1 are out of bounds, so you have a row above/below and a column either left or right that is 'out of bounds'.

@Asmodeus 

Picture it as ""Scanning"" over the original bitmap/array for the image, then creating a second array that stores this recorded information that's then  ""mirrored"" at each pixel in the original bitmap, into a new ""Copy"" of this bitmap. 

Then after you have an array of: 

1. The original bitmap
2. The new ""copy"" of this bitmap with the mirrored information 

You can then loop through the original bitmap and replace each index of that with the information at the adjacent index for each pixel in the ""Copied"" bitmap.","",""

I implemented grayscale, sepia, and reverse all in one shot last night, but then when I read Blur I knew it was time to stop and think. Went to bed, couldn't sleep, spent all night thinking of an algorithm that didn't require special cases for corners or edges. Woke up this AM, came downstairs opened a text editor, typed out my algorithm (no IDE), tested by hand with my own cases, and then ported over to the IDE. What an intense 12-hours lol

I think about it more conceptually like a moving 3x3 matrix that moves along the larger NxN matrix doing the computations. The way I described it to my friend was like a magnifying glass looking at a map and then moving the magnifying glass left to right and top to bottom. The trick is to ""recognize"" when the magnifying glass isn't looking at the map and to know how to ignore that data

I think about it more conceptually like a moving 3x3 matrix that moves along the larger NxN matrix doing the computations. The way I described it to my friend was like a magnifying glass looking at a map and then moving the magnifying glass left to right and top to bottom. The trick is to ""recognize"" when the magnifying glass isn't looking at the map and to know how to ignore that data

In a NxN matrix called X you just need to consider if element Xij are within the space of N. It's like imagining that an NxN matrix has an element [-1,-1] in a ""virtual space"" and then ignoring that element. It's like having a sub of your NxN matrix where some of the sub elements don't exist in the space of the parent N space. Said more simply. Submatrix is a key part of how I did it and I think probably the common answer

my code work if i divide it by 3.000, but doesnt work if i divide it simply by 3
any idea why this could be happening?","",""
"698534327977377842","Kremlin_showers#1199","12-May-20 11:10 AM","because how integer division works in c. if you divide an int by an int then the result is simply the rounded down int for example 10/3 = 3 in C and 7 / 2 = 3 or 99 / 10 = 9. but when you use 3.0 it takes the number as a float and returns the correct value in decimal 99 / 10.0 = 9.9","",""
