"393854278764068875","curiouskiwi#1671","07-Jan-18 02:42 AM","@Elliot   abs is 'absolute value'.  The bi.biHeight value can be either negative or positive (it indicates a top-down or bottom-up arrangement of the pixels in the file).  But if you are using that value as a counter, then you always want it to be a positive number, so you can use the `abs` function to ensure that.  Remember that the absolute value of any number is positive.","","😀 (1)"

```
Similar to fread, fwrite writes out to file fp an element of size bytes blocks number of times. So, for example, if size is 50 and blocks 10, then fwrite will write to fp 10 times, each time a ""chunk"" of 50 bytes (for a total of 500 bytes). On each fwrite, it will write from the buffer pointer to by ptr.

So if your buffer is the size of a triple (3 bytes), and then you say fwrite 3 blocks ... fwrite's ptr will be positioned at the beginning of the buffer, and then read 9 consecutive bytes to write.  So you'll end up writing the 3 bytes in the buffer and then whatever 6 bytes happen to be in memory after it.","",""

Check50 seems to await for very precise results and i'm kinda confused about that. The logic i based my program upon is that, when shrinking an image, we won't print all the pixels of the given image, if i want to shrink my image by a factor of, let's say 1/10, i will only copy 1/10 of the original pixels. So, knowing that, we have to make a choice of which pixels we want to keep and which pixels we want to discard. We have to make a selection and this selection, even though it should make sense and be an efficient selection, will remain at least a bit arbitrary. I could keep the first pixel and then discard the 9 others, or discard the 9 first pixels and keep the last one, etc... That makes for a very imprecise result, but it still is a kinda logical one, i guess ?

If check50 is expecting a precise result, obviously there must be something wrong with the way i'm thinking about the problem. As much as i'd like to figure it out on my own, i could use a bit of clarification... Thank you !","",""

```  `BITMAPFILEHEADER` is a typedef for the structure defined in bmp.h  so this simply declares a variable called `bf` of that type.  Much like you might say `int num;` would declare a variable called `num` that will hold one integer.  The next line then reads from the input file the value that you then store in the variable `bf`.   (and same for the other header).  There is no need to use malloc.  If you want to create another header variable, you can simply declare it and set it equal to the existing one.

That doesn't seem very accurate.... Are you sure it would work with all the different image scaling algorithms?

6 pixels    18 bytes  + 2 padding = 20
5 pixels    15 bytes  + 1 padding = 16
4 pixels    12 bytes  + 0 padding  = 12

2 pixels     6 bytes  + 2  padding = 8

The checker does not have test cases for factors like `0.33` or `1.5` (though in my opinion, it should), and other properties are also pretty nice to your code.
There are various more robust versions. A very primitive approach might be for each output pixel to calculate the corresponding input pixel, and `fseek` to its position in input, this approach is indifferent of scaling up or down. I did something else, keeping track of the difference in progress between reading input and writing output, and write as long as output is behind. Applied the same vertically and horizontally, this will drop or duplicate as needed. Other people implemented linear interpolation. Try to write your code in a way it does not break or provide inconsistent results (dimensions in header differ from those in bitmap) if dimension * factor is not an integer.","",""

I am trying to figure out how to change the values within the header files.  

I understand this code:
 // read infile's BITMAPINFOHEADER

    fread(&bi, sizeof(BITMAPINFOHEADER), 1, inptr);

Will read in the file that was opened for reading the data within BITMAPINFOHEADER.

    // write outfile's BITMAPINFOHEADER
    fwrite(&bi, sizeof(BITMAPINFOHEADER), 1, outptr);

will write that date to the outfield.

Nothing special…it is the copy.c code, but I added a few lines at 74. I will copy the lines below:         
         //my sandbox....
        printf (""Size of BMFIH: %li\n"", sizeof(BITMAPINFOHEADER));

        bf.bfReserved1 = 256;
        printf (""size of bfReserved1 = %i\n"", bf.bfReserved1);
 I am simply trying to understand how to read the files…for example, if I compile the code and run, and then open up the newly created file in hex, I can view each address.  For example, at bite 0 you see 42 4d which validates this as a BMP.  That makes sense to me.  SO I thought, let’s change the values in the tables (BITMAPFILEHEADER and BITMAPINFOHEADER)…then I can check to see if they are reflected in the actual file. 

And that is where I get lost.  Since when I run the code, it prints out   Size of BMFIH: 40
Size of BMIH: 14
size of biWidth = 256
size of bfReserved1 = 256

Perfect…what I would expect.
 But when I open the newly created file, and look at address 18 it shows a value of 8…what?  I changed it with the code size of biWidth = 256, did I not?   Same is true with address 8.   Any help appreciated","",""

And I know for smiley.bmp there is no padding.  So 8 pixels x 8 pixels = 64 total pixels.   With 3 bytes per pixel, that takes us to 192 bytes.   Is that correct?   

I run ~cs50/pset3/peek smiley.bmp for the value for biSizeImage I get: 34      DWORD  biSizeImage      000000c0.   And I believe c0 is the same as 192...","",""

"218368025089409024","Brewslee#6566","22-Feb-19 11:02 PM","Hey guys, got a question regarding file pointers and fread/frwrite. 

in copy.c inptr and outptr are file pointers to the input and output image files. I assume that, just like an array, file pointers would point to the first bit of the file in memory. Also in copy.c there is a sequence of 'fread BITMAPFILEHEADER' > 'fread BITMAPINFOHEADER' > 'fread RGBTRIPLE'. 

My question is: If the file pointer points to the first bit of the file, how does fread know where to start reading from? The first time fread is used, it would read sizeof(BITMAPFILEHEADER) from beginning of the file but the second time fread is used, does it remember where it last 'read' and reads the next chunk of bytes?","",""

"218368025089409024","Brewslee#6566","22-Feb-19 11:25 PM","@curiouskiwi thanks, that's what I thought. My followup question is, how does fseek work with fread and fwrite. 

I used printf to see if the address stored within the file pointer changed after each write/read and it doesn't so the file pointers inputr and outptr are, let's say, constant in copy.c. 

So in fseek(inptr, padding, SEEK_CUR); SEEK_CUR tells fseek to go to the address inptr points to  and offset it by sizeof(padding). I know it's written so that fseek should go to last read position, but inptr is pointing to the beginning of the file....so there's something missing in my logic here or I misunderstood something.","","🤔 (1)"

The farthest i've gotten is to have the code properly write each triple twice and add appropraite padding. Currently I'm trying to transition to printing the line twice but am having a lot of trouble and am not sure why, using the first pseudocode from the prompt as a basis. I plan on going at from scratch later, any advice would be appreciated.  Heres a link to a pastebin with my current (not so great) code. Thanks. https://pastebin.com/0ZSpsRyX","",""

I wrote my code in a way that it calculates target dimensions (`round`ing to whole numbers), then forgets about the factor and uses input and output dimensions only. That way, output is always consistent, and bitmap fits the header data.

My multiply/drop algorithm would duplicate the middle row in this case, just because I thought it looked better. I also wrote an algorithm that does weighted average, for that it obviously stays symmetric.

When dealing with weird factors, I found it best to use the factor to calculate output image dimensions, and then never look at the factor again (but instead using the old and new dimensions), working with integers only, not floating point numbers. which might be rounded/truncated in different ways.","",""

For the implementation, maybe resize in one direction first (creating a stretched image), and then add the other to your code. Horizontal is a bit easier.
Also, ""on paper"" (actually in vivid imagination, but for a beginner, paper is likely the right medium), I made a kind of ""mapping"" for the bitmap, having the input pixel for each output pixel, and where to skip/write which padding (input and output padding differ in general). Then I would write code that's designed to replicate that transformation (maybe write pseudo-code first), my mind keeping track of the position within input and output bitmap (again something I would have used paper for, marking position with a pen or some small object).","",""

I'm quite lost.

So far:
1) Copied copy.c
2) Did the basic boring stuff. (Check for argc !=4 error, stored n as a long called 'size_multi', confirmed n is between 1-100 inclusive.
3) After ""ensuring infile is 24-bit BMP, set bi.biWidth and bi.biHeight to *= size_multi (have a feeling this is wrong as it's called in the for loops later)
4) int padding is now set with new bi.biWidth via step (3). Otherwise, did not change provided assignment from copy.c
5)  did not change fwrite() for BITMAPINFORHEADER and BITMAPFILEHEADER alone as the adjustments are made earlier in the code.
6) did not change ""iterate over infile's scanline"" for loop
7) did not change ""iterate over pixels in scanline"" for loop
8) Here I'm stuck
9) I suppose I'm meant to fwrite 2 'triple's for every 1 read, but I have no idea how to begin. Read through the online documentation and re-watched most of the lecture (starting after the training-wheels-drop) and still remain lost.
10) Of course, I want to actually learn this and not be handed the answer, but man I feel completely unequipped for this one.

Thank in advance, team!","",""

Now, if you loop using the old code which loops through height and width value, then basically you're looping through a file that at some point doesn't have content to provide. If the old file's height and width are 3, you're going to loop 6 times and they don't have the data to provide you","",""

There were few red dots together surrounded by few of white dots on all sides, and so on. Like one could instead of using a temporary array, and move the cursor back a row for vertical resize; moving the cursor accordingly while inside the reading and writing loop, I was wondering if one could write a program to: say if a red dot is surrounded by white dots on all sides change the red to white or vice versa, if a red is surrounded by white and blue dots, change all to whatever color are the maximum number of dots, or for a better algorithm consider this for multiple layers of surrounding. Might be a bit more complicated but, one could filter noise in an image, and say as a part of project, count the number of objects in an image upto uncertainty of the scale.

1. Create the array (we did)

3. Once you've filled the array, you need to write the array strech-1 times (you've already done 1 row by fwriting before)

Basically because, let's say for enlarging 2 times:
I read + write 2 times and add padding, move cursor back to the line
I do the same thing the second time 
I read + write 2 times and add padding, all nice and dandy *and I move the cursor back again*
I then break out of the loop and skip padding in the infile, but because I already moved my cursor, it's off... so the next time I read, when I am supposed to be reading the second row of the infile, I am basically reading into the middle of an RGB tripple, so then I get a different output

"255162012303228930","allsunday#1958","05-Sep-19 01:25 PM","tl;dr: take int size out of the main function argument and just use argc and argv. It's not that size isn't an int but that main can't take an int as third argument, and in fact nor can it take an int as a second argument.

full answer: you can't just pass any argument to the main function and you want to pass argc and argv. The latter is an array of strings that will store the arguments passed **on execution** (not the same as the arguments passed to the main function), and argc stores the number of arguments passed. The terminal says that if main is taking a third argument it can't just be anything you want, but must be something of type char \*\*, and that's definitely different from an int. The good news is that you can work just with the first two arguments and don't need to add that third one (that I have no idea what it is and why would you even want to do that, but I'm learning just like you).

Now, to understand what the deal is with char \**, you have to know what pointers are. That's week 3 stuff but basically, in case you're curious, saying char *arr[] is equivalent, in this context, to saying char **arr. The first is an array of char pointers and the second is a pointer to char pointer.  So, essentially, the error says that if main takes a third argument it has to be of the same type as the second argument it takes, aka argv","",""

Regarding the BITMAPFILEHEADER and BITMAPINFOHEADER the components that I'm changing are:

bfSize
biHeight
biWidth
biSize
biSizeImage.

How I am changing them is I am taking the number input by the user in the argv array, converting that number to an int called n, then after I have read the infile, I am creating new BITMADFILEHEADER and BITMAPINFOHEADER data types, taking the above elements from the infile, multiplying by n (bicopy.biheight = bi.biHeight * n), then writing those modified values into the outfile (I don't want to alter the original's values because I'll need those to remain accurate for when I'm iterating over scanlines).

Am I doing something right or am I running in totally the wrong direction here?","",""

"208359344385949697","AngloFalcon#9484","12-Oct-19 07:05 PM","Hmm, will it have the same effect if I just copy everything that was stored in bi into bi1, then only after that start altering the details? So the way it stands when I debug it, after my changes, although biWidth (for example) is multiplied by *n*, biSize remains 40, like the original. I then write the outfile according to the values stored in bi1, not bi. So the outfile gets the bfSize, biHeight, biWidth and biSizeImage multiplied by the user input number, but everything else (such as biSize) remains the same as the input file","",""
"208359344385949697","AngloFalcon#9484","12-Oct-19 07:15 PM","Also, if anyone is feeling patient, I would appreciate a nudge in the right direction figuring out how to multiply the height of the image when writing it out. 
Basically, once we are into the section where we are iterating over the infile's scanlines and writing to the outfile, what I'm doing is reading the RGBTRIPLE from the infile, storing it in `triple` (as per the original code), but when it comes to writing it, I'm setting it in a while loop and setting the condition to if k < n (n being the number the user inputted). The desired effect being that the pixel will write to the already resized outfile n number of times before moving onto the next pixel. 

Then, according to the original code, it writes any padding that is required before moving onto the next scanline and the process is repeated. What I'm finding tricky is figuring out how I can increase the height of the file by n, because I understand I need to copy that whole row/scanline n number of times to correctly resize","",""

Resize (more) though, seems impossible if I use the direction given in the tutorial.  If I split the functionality of enlarging and shrinking, then I can't handle cases where f is > 1 and not a whole number.  I found a solution online that projects a square of the required new pixel onto the old pixels to see how much each pixel contributes.  That's about as elegant as I can imagine the solution would be but then the advice given in the tutorial to ""Then just rescale vertically""  for the Resize(more) problem seems completely useless.  The pixel projection method would require that I store multiple rows of pixels (probably the whole image) and a multidimensional array of RGBTRIPLEs, and then read from there.  That's nothing like the solution hinted at in the walkthrough video.  Is there a better way to implement for Resize(more)?","",""

'fread(currentLine, sizeof(RGBTRIPLE), oldWidth, inptr);'
to read an entire line, and currentLine seems like a perfect situation to declare as a pointer and then use dynamic memory allocation based on the width of the initial image.

However, in resize (less) I write the ""horizontally scaled"" pixel all at once to the new file:
RGB triple[n] where n is the scaling factor, and then initialise each element with the old pixel info, and then write to file (to reduce fread calls, although I realised afterwards that there is a further improvement on this)
Would this be another instance where dynamic memory is useful?  It seems somehow simpler to me to just declare an array...  And calling malloc and then free within a loop...  I don't have a good idea of how that impacts performance","",""

It's been a while so I don't precisely remember what I did to change that but I think I just changed the padding equations so that it was at least in a line. 

Last time I went over it with a debugger I think I found the numbers to be good, but looking at it now should oldPadding come out as 3 if the originaly row size was 3? Figured it had to be a multiple a 4 and 3+3 is not a multiple a four so just a bit confused there. 

Other than that I'm pretty sure the issue is related to my for loop or the RGB values changing (since it's a rainbow) or both. However, at a glance it makes sense to me logically so I don't know what's going on or even really how to troubleshoot it.","",""

And back to the topic of order: remember, your program is compiled top to bottom. If you adjust overal size using Width and Height, and *then* change Width and Height, your higher formula uses *old* values of those; it doesn't know you're gonna change them. If this part is confusing, spam printf() at each point where you use or change values - it will help you keep track of what equals what at any point. And consider if you'll maybe need some of those old values later - sometimes making new variables for adjusted values and keeping the old ones intact is a good idea","",""
