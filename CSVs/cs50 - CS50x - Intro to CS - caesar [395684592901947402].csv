I manipulate my expression further in the program and I am no including it here for academic honesty.  But the expression works that way I want,performing arithmetic on the ascii value and assigning the result to an int variable.

Do not assume that k will be less than or equal to 26. Your program should work for all non-negative integral values of k less than 231 - 26. In other words, you don’t need to worry if your program eventually breaks if the user chooses a value for k that’s too big or almost too big to fit in an int. (Recall that an int can overflow.) But, even if k is greater than 26, alphabetical characters in your program’s input should remain alphabetical characters in your program’s output. For instance, if k is 27, A should not become [ even though [ is 27 positions away from A in ASCII, per asciichart.com; A should become B, since B is 27 positions away from A, provided you wrap around from Z to A.

So, the hint gives you a different approach.  You can store argv[1] in a string called `k`.

int key = atoi(k);``` and you'd then have the same ultimate result ... an integer that holds the key.  But there's no need to use that extra step.","",""

When encrypting a message using a Caesar cipher, you can find the number of places that we need to shift from the start of the alphabet to encrypt the message by using the following formula:

e(x) = (x + k) % 26

where x is the letter that is being encrypted, k is the key value, and % is the modulo operator.

int key = atoi(argv[1]);

        printf(""Usage: ./caesar key\n"");

Recall that a string, meanwhile, is just an array of chars.
Recall that the string.h header file contains a number of useful functions that work with strings.
Recall that we can use a loop to iterate over each character of a string if we know its length.
Recall that the ctype.h header file contains a number of useful functions that tell us things about characters.```","",""
"541026821320212510","Duke of Denali#5725","02-Feb-19 02:11 AM","@curiouskiwi I found the 2017 pset descriptions for Caesar (and others) to be much more useful and descriptive, particularly in the  ""hints"" section. The descriptions flow beautifully and are reinforced with example code instead of boring bullet points prefaced with ""Recall..."". A great example is with the atoi function. The 2017 description shows and code example of it's usage ""int k = atoi(argv[1]);"" rather than simply suggesting atoi may be helpful. The 2017 description also gives the hint that isalpha, isupper, etc. are very useful. There are numerous other examples where the newer pset specs are less helpful than 2017 and earlier. I was very confused as to how to solve Caesar until I read the 2017 description along with Zamyla's section YouTube live walkthrough. They don't give it away, but they help you approach it with the required tools. Hope this helps others.","","👌🏻 (1)"

`isdigit` expects a single `char`. `isupper` also expects a single `char`. Both will behave weird if you pass something else (the way they are implemented, the compiler can't do type checks on them, so they will crash hard on running the programme).
Declaring `plaintext` and `letters` within conditionally executed code blocks makes little sense. Variables cease to exist once you leave the block they were declared in.
You have no code for the case of non-letter characters (which should be printed without modification).
The design using an inner loop is not very efficient, checking out the ASCII table could give you a maths-based approach that does not require a `letters` helper array/string.","",""

The brackets in the declaration say to the compiler that `argv` must be an array of strings. But in the line where the function is called from `main()`, this `argv` already _is_ an array of strings, the compiler already knows it (from its declaration in the parameters of `main()`) and does not need any reminders. It only wants to check if the type of the main's `argv` and compare it with the type of checkdig's `argv` to make sure that they fit. So when arrays are _used_ (not just, um, promised in the list of parameters), there are never empty brackets: either no brackets at all (when you want to take the array as a whole and, for example, give it to some function) or brackets with an index (when you want to take an element of the array).","",""

I thought I cleverly limited what gets changed by the cipher logic (it skipped non alpha elements when I was testing it, but I guess I didn't test it enough) and the scope and I thought it would roll back to 'a' if it went over z, but... as much as it ignore non alpha elements from the plaintext, if I add the key and the count goes beyond z, it just uses non-alpha ascii characters of value higher than z.
I've spent so long on this (I was concentrating on the wrong thing lol, but everything is a lesson!) and I can't believe I didn't come across this when testing!","",""

Modify caesar.c at right such that instead of printing out the command-line argument provided, your program instead checks to make sure that each character of that command line argument is a decimal digit (i.e., 0, 1, 2, etc.) and, if any of them are not, terminates (with a return code of 1) after printing the message `Usage: ./caesar key`. But if the argument consists solely of digit characters, you should convert that string (recall that `argv` is an array of strings, even if those strings happen to look like numbers) to an actual integer. As luck would have it, a function, `atoi`, exists for exactly that purpose. Here’s how you might use it:

If you'd had made your compiler log warnings (options -Wall -Wextras -pedantic for gcc) it would have notified you about the missing prototype for atoi().

"393854278764068875","curiouskiwi#1671","20-Sep-19 01:08 AM","One concept you may be missing (it seems a common issue) is that the Caesar formula 

`(pi + k) % 26`

assumes that your plain char is represented by a value in the range of 0-25.  In your code , assuming you use`p` for your plaintext, p[i] will be holding the ASCII value of the character.  You need to convert that ascii value  into its numerical 0-25 index value.  So a char like 'C' is 2.  

Once you've done that, you can plug it into the caesar formula to get the enciphered char value.  Note that it will also be in the range of 0-25, so you'll then need to shift that value back up into the ASCII range to print it as a character.

As a hint, you know the letters are in order, so that 'C' is 2 more than 'A', so can you see how you might use subtraction (and later, addition) to do this shift?","",""

So, when the user executes the program they write ""./caesar 20"". The first string ""./caesar"" is passed to the main function as argv[0] and ""20"" is passed as argv[1], I believe. And I think it's stored as a string rather than an int, so I need to convert it before I can do math with it. The instructions mention a method called atoi() which I believe converts strings to ints. So after my main function receives 20, do I need to convert it to an int and save it in a new variable, perhaps called ""key""?","",""

To give you a little boost: Try to read the instructions several times and write pseudocode for what steps you believe will take you to the solution. ASCII table - I can't emphasize enough how important it is to find it online and study where exactly all alphabetic characters are located, how they are grouped, and how many there are.

Then the number of the next letter after Z (letter №26) will be (26+1)%26=1 which gives A again. But if it is any other sequence of numbers, you can't expect the same effect. 127%26 will not be 101, it will be some garbage, not even from the alphabet zone. If the program uses module operator like that, it has to convert any codes to numbers from {1,2,3,...26} first (and back to codes after the cypher is applied).","",""

About the key wrapping: I assume keeping track of *increase* is how you're trying to do that? But for it to come into play, it needs to be i) iterated where plaintext characters are changed and ii) used as an index for *key*. If it's difficult to wrap your head around how it works, try to print variables at every step of the program, so you could see how they change and affect each other.
P.S. Consider properly using shift() function after all. You can do the program without it, but functions are going to be *huge* further on, in other languages too, so figuring it out now will serve you well.","",""

@Andrewoca Remember, when you `return`, you actually quit the function. Think of what happens in you example, when the input is `34xx`: since `3` is a digit, the code inside the `else` block is going to get executed, and you're going to `return` (that is, quit) the function.","",""

@Beist Saying `true != true` wouldn't cause an error, because it's just asking a question: is true different from true? And the answer is, of course, false.
Your problem might be with `isdigit()`. It doesn't take an entire `string` as an argument; rather, it takes a single `char`. So you can't just ask if the entire key is a digit (`isdigit(argv[1])`); you have to go over each character of the key individually and ask if it is a digit.","",""

@rby2005 It seems you used isdigit function to check whether argv[1] has any digits. IMO this will exclude cases where argv[1] has a mix of digits and alphabetical characters.

The real problem lies in is how much you understand division.

In Euclidean division. let say N for the nominator and D for the denominator. We by doing division are looking for how many numbers of D goes into N, right? true.

Division is just continues subtraction. And when the Euclidean algorithm can't proceed any further subtraction because the remaining number is actually less than D, So let us just settle there and call it R (the remainder) and what ever number we accumulated call it Q (the quotient).

Thus we understand from this whole operation that R actually can't be greater or equal to D. so the rest of the division is always going to be less than the divisor.
This is why s[i] % 26 only gives values from 0-25, Which they're not actually proper indexes from alphabetical character in ASCII table, So we should look for a way to return the indexes to their correct position (Differ between lower & upper case characters).

Hope that help!","",""

@MrBlood 
I was using a variable of char type to save the ith character of entered string and then adding the key to it. So 
char c = plaintext[i]; 
c += key;
However this has a problem whenever the value of c is more than 127. It's because the char type's value range is from  -127 to 127 or 0 to 255 and we don't have the control to say system to store char as 0 to 255 ( different compiler chooses differently)

If the compiler chooses to compile char as -127 to 127 ( like our cs50 IDE) any value more than 127 cannot be stored and fails to work as expected.

I then used a unsigned char type which always stores range from 0 to 255 and hence fixed the bug","",""

But I actually don't understand unsigned char data type. You choose this data type just to get the ceiling higher? or there is another reason?
I myself used int instead of char, At first I thought of changing the string characters itself but this is not possible in C as far as I know...","",""
