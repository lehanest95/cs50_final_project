Hoping somebody here can give me some pointers as to where my logic is flawed. My ""print winner"" logic is as follows; 

If candidate_count = 1, print that candidates name and return. 

Then I declare an int n as the (int) amount of votes the first candidate received. 

Then I use a loop. 
It checks if the first candidates votes > the next candidates votes, AND that (i+1)  is < candidate_count to ensure that the ""next"" actually is a candidate. If the conditions are filled, it changes the value of n two that candidates number of votes. 

Then I use an simple if- condition to check the last candidates votes is > the second to last candidates votes. 

Then lastly I use a final loop to to check how many candidates have the votes of number n (which was decided by to first loop or the if-formula.) and then print each of candidates with that number of votes. 

When I use check50 it fails on ""prints Alice as winner"" and ""prints Charlie"" as winner. Every other check succeeds. 

I am failing to reproduce any circumstance where this code does not print the winner candidate(s). Any good ideas for tests or ideas where my logic fails?","",""

This is supposed to be an introductory course where I am supposed to learn, invest in making mistakes so I can make use of them in the future. However I've just found myself reading through how people attempted to solve the Problem Set. There is even a hashtag on discord for that. 
Teach the student arithmetic and he can be a physician? Or teach them alphabet and expect them to write a short story, right? Wrong. Let me give you a constructive feedback: If the students are NOT able to solve the problem sets on their own, then you're missing a pedagogical point.  It only creates more and more people get alienated and refrain from even watching the next lecture.  I believe I am not alone in my thoughts.","",""

Its at this exploratory phase of the course you will have the thirst to seek out things when you get an error. Computer science is always about predictability and when you follow some basic steps then you can always predict the result with a great accuracy, the lectures teach you these basic steps which you are expected to apply and predict the result in Problem sets or the corner cases as well. 
While C isn't a language that's used as we think, there definitely exists a good chunk of software that uses C concepts, and why should we say C concepts, I'd say the lectures teach you about arrays, algorithms, variables, even structs which are a modified form of classes and objects. These building blocks are something same in every programming language(atleast most) and when you hard learn these and move over to python its going to be an easy step.
In addition to it I request everyone to do both the less comfortable and more comfortable, because it makes you confident and lot of code and concept  is reused from less to more comfortable, taking very less time for you to solve the more comfortable problem.
Finally I'd say these are lectures and at this level, student's should seek out the answer using Malan's directions which I believe would bee very beneficial. Its definitely not for Malan and his team to handhold people in solving problems that's something they are expected to do on their own. Its finally about not leaving the course and holding on to it until the end would help you excel in this field.","",""

Moreover, some are discouraged and made believe that maybe programming is not for them. I am not gonna quit learning programming, But I am going to find a more suitable course on Edx or Udemy.

I am using two string variables for the ties (tie1 and tie2), and they are within scope, otherwise I couldn't print them. I check to see if they are empty with an if statement, and if they have a string, they print. But if there is a single winner, I get the winner printed (a string var of top), and then a segmentation fault. debug50 doesn't seem to acknowledge the fault (it ends with a blank line after the single winner).

@curiouskiwi Yes,

There was a space in
printf(""%s \n"", candidates[i].name);

So I changed it to 

printf(""%s\n"", candidates[i].name);

Now it works. 

Thanks!!! 😄","",""
