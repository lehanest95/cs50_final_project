I've been watching the pset video and working through it but I'm a little bit confused as to how the data is going to be stored on this ""memory stick"" - we read the stick 512 bytes at a time but how do we know when we've reached the end of a file? Are they literally back-to-back so I just need to read ahead, check the header and then, if the header exists, close off the old file, rewind 512 to the beginning of this new header and then start saving in a new file? We're not taking in to account that there might be random bytes in between files in this scenario?","",""
"161289504747945984","LiberaVeritas#1294","28-Dec-17 11:51 PM","Everything is aligned to the block so no data will start in the middle of the block.
If you find a jpg header at the start of the block, then the jpg data starts from there up to the point a new data header is at the start of a block.
Jpgs can span multiple blocks.","",""

I was just thinking as I go through the data I will need to use fread to collect 512 bytes and then, only if it doesn't have a jpg header in it, I would need to rewind 512 bytes and then use fwrite to add it to the .jpg file. However thinking about this ""out loud""  I guess I could just put it all in a buffer and do it from there. So that'll probably be easier to do I guess?","",""

I searched up online and it seems that it has to do with allocating read-only memory if i use char * and i get segmentation fault because im trying to write onto it, but malloc doesn't work (or maybe i don't know the proper syntax for allocating write memory using malloc) unless I use char *, which seems to be read-only.

Your while loop checks if the amount of data read in from ""raw"" into ""buffer"" is equal to 512 bytes. Recall that a usual ""int"" is a signed, 32-bit data type and so a buffer of size  512 that consists of ints will be 512 * 32 = 16,384 bytes large.
However, there exists another data type called an ""unsigned char"" that is an unsigned, 1 byte large, integer storage type (even though it can be used for storing characters). So when you read 512 bytes into a buffer of 512 unsigned char's, the buffer you will read into will be 512 * 1 = 512 bytes large.
Therefore, the code inside your while loop will run if your buffer uses the appropriate data type (ints are not appropriate).","",""

here is the code that works:  https://gist.github.com/MaxIsTheDog4U/bda69a7564f5c76d8cebd2449bb6f2f3

Note this is not the final recover code...I made this to work with 1 bmp.  Once I get this to work and understand I think the jpg problem will be easier.

my question has to do with opening and tracking the outfile.  In the first version of the code above, I did not declare the outfile before entering the while loop.  The second version (which compiles and works) I simply opened AND closed the outfile before entering the loop...and problem solved.

But my question is when I port this over to scan the raw file, I will be creating multiple outfiles.  Each with a different name...

so I guess my question is, will the logic I am using for the second version work (where I declare the outpointer before the loop) for recover?","",""

Not sure if that is still true for file systems that have special optimization for tiny files, where multiple tiny files could be squeezed into a single cluster, but for the file systems on SD-cards as used in most cameras, it is. Those are kept simple, as they must be easy to implement with little resources in the device.","","👍 (2)"

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)

1)  Check first 4 bytes for JPEG. Enter conditional.

3)  fopen() to *img with ""w"" permission. [so far so good as I'm able to write the files for 512B]
4)  fwrite() first block
5) 'fseek(inptr , 512, SEEK_CUR);' in order to get to next block so I can check the opposite of our ""find jpeg conditional""

So I've stumbled across an error and I am actually somewhat stumped as to what is happening because I thought everything was implemented correctly. The issue is twofold.

1. Before the while loop that collects the bytes of data from the card and prints to the output file, I set an int counter to 0. I'm using that within the loop so that I can create the names of the jpegs with sprintf. So essentially `int counter = 0;`, then I create an array of six chars to hold the name `unsigned char name[6]`.
Within the loop, I then say `sprintf(name, ""%03i.jpg"", counter)`. However, at some point in that process, counter gains an extra +103 value, meaning that the first file prints out 000.jpg and the second 104.jpg. I don't understand this. 🤔 

2. The bigger problem - my program currently collects two jpegs, then just stops. Sometimes it says `File size limit exceeded` but how is this true, if the buffer is 512 bytes and it's iterating across the card through a loop? I'm pretty stuck right now, because I feel I must have a misconception of one of the functions or data types.","",""

`While (fread(buffer, 512, 1, outptr))

fread moves the file pointer forward by `size` number of bytes, which is 512 bytes in your case.

what you're effectively doing is loading 512 bytes in buff, checking that it does contain valid data, then loading the next 512 bytes from the file into buff again (or trying to). so you're reading 1024 bytes with each iteration, and not checking if the second read is valid before trying to access data from it","",""

I would use `while`, not `do..while`, and move the `fread` into the loop condition.
You still process a block (do the header check and write to the output file) after you got the sign that `fread` could not get 512 bytes. I guess that's what gets you a :(
Something smells about that one:
```C
            fclose(f);
            rmdr = fread(buffer, 1, 512, f);
```
You read from a closed file? Wouldn't have read anything, as your last `fread` already hit file end.
Literally everything is same whether `filename==0` or not, except the `fclose`. So only that one would have to go into an `if`, the rest could come after that.
You wouldn't have to add `fwrite` in your header block handling if you turned your `else if` into an `if`.","",""

It doesn't care if there is enough room.  So imagine that the compiler gave you address 100 for the filename, and allocated locations 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106  to it.  But you also declare a buffer to hold your 512 bytes, so the compiler sees the next free spot in memory is location 107. so allocates 107 - 618 for that.  
You read in 512 bytes.  And let's say here's your memory: ```
100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 ...
                            ff   d8  ff  e0  ...```   and now you find a signature and sprintf your ""000.jpg"" string into the filename: ```
'0' '0' '0' '.' 'j' 'p' 'g' '\0' d8  ff  e0  ...   ```what's happened?  Can you see that the null char from your filename has now overwritten the first byte of your buffer?  Now, every one of your jpgs will start with `00` instead of `ff` because fwrite grabs what's in the buffer starting at location 107, but you've corrupted it by not having enough space for your filename.","","❤️ (1)"

Things it took a lot of time for me to wrap my head around (They might be simple for other people though)

1. fread() sort of works like you're looping. Everytime you call it it ""moves"" the n elements you've read before. This means that every value that reads is different. 

2.  think of fcread like a lens, the 2nd and 3rd argument it's just the size of that lens. You then drag your lens across the file and everytime you stop you take a picture of it and store it in the buffer. Took me a while to really understand this 🙈

@220284hk @Muhammad Usman   the 0x00 in the first byte of your buffer is the NULL char that sprintf added to the end of the filename string. `sprintf` wrote the bytes `'0' '0' '0' '.' 'j' 'p' 'g' '\0'` where it belonged, but because your array had only 7 bytes allocated to it, the last byte (the null) simply overwrote the memory in that slot ... which just happens to be the memory that was allocated for your buffer.  So buffer[0] then became 0x00","",""

We then do `fread` in order to read everything within the file. What I'm confused is the properties of `fread`. How would we know how to input those properties? For example the size in bytes for each element to be read? Wouldn't it be of random size each? Thanks for the help in getting my head around the start.","",""

I started this exercise three days ago and after trying thousands of different things I've been able to print the images at least. Before asking, I've checked this topic since 1st of April and @Sanath was very helpful with the instructions to follow. To be honest, several times I made the right thing just by trying ""random code"" than actually understanding what I was doing (because ""fread"" and ""fread"" were kind of difficult to understand for me). I haven't even used ""BYTE"" or ""malloc"" because my knowledge is very limited (even if I've watched the lecture and the sorts many times) and I don't still get how to use that information but thankfully, my approach worked. There is only one issue, I print 50 images but only half of them are actually right. Only the even images but not the odd ones are fully printed in the right way. Any idea about why it's doing that?

@IkeKap I had to google a bit about fread(), it was not super obvious to me how to use the return value syntactically as well. What I did is to ||declare an int and assign to it the value of fread and use the variable to break the loop which cycles the blocks.|| There might be a better way 🤔","",""
