The database works using SQL commands in the command line, I'm just having problems running the SQL commands using python and SQLAlchemy. I have psql 10.4,  SQLAlchemy 1.2.10, psycopg2 2.7.5 and psycopg2-binary 2.7.5. installed I edited my pb_hba.conf file to be md5 instead of peer. Is there some setup stage I'm missing?

You could use a formatted string but it's dangerous and can lead to a potential SQL injection. So you need to sanitize your input and only allow a `search_type`from a predifined list. Example:
```Python
if search_type in [""isbn"", ""title"", ""author""]:

Objectives
Become more comfortable with Django.
Gain experience with relational database design.
Overview
In this project, you’ll build an web application for handling a pizza restaurant’s online orders. Users will be able to browse the restaurant’s menu, add items to their cart, and submit their orders. Meanwhile, the restaurant owners will be able to add and update menu items, and view orders that have been placed.

Milestones
We recommend that you try to meet the following milestones in order:

Complete the Menu, Adding Items, and Registration/Login/Logout steps.
Complete the Shopping Cart and Placing an Order steps.
Complete the Viewing Orders and Personal Touch steps.
Getting Started
Python and Django
As with Projects 1 and 2, make sure that you have a copy of Python 3.6 or higher installed on your machine. You’ll also need to install pip. If you downloaded Python from Python’s website, you likely already have pip installed (you can check by running pip in a terminal window). If you don’t have it installed, be sure to install it before moving on!

To run this Django application:","",""
"490048642950889482","Vikas18#5132","16-Sep-18 05:43 AM","Download the project3 distribution code from https://cdn.cs50.net/web/2018/spring/projects/3/project3.zip and unzip it.
In a terminal window, navigate into your project3 directory. Note that this is the directory for a Django project called pizza, inside of which is an app already created for you called orders.
Run pip3 install -r requirements.txt in your terminal window to make sure that all of the necessary Python packages (Django, in this instance) are installed.
Run python manage.py runserver to start up your Django application.
If you navigate to the URL provided by Django, you should see the text ""Project 3: TODO""!
Requirements
Alright, it’s time to actually build your web application! Here are the requirements:

Menu: Your web application should support all of the available menu items for Pinnochio’s Pizza & Subs (a popular pizza place in Cambridge). It’s up to you, based on analyzing the menu and the various types of possible ordered items (small vs. large, toppings, additions, etc.) to decide how to construct your models to best represent the information. Add your models to orders/models.py, make the necessary migration files, and apply those migrations.
Adding Items: Using Django Admin, site administrators (restaurant owners) should be able to add, update, and remove items on the menu. Add all of the items from the Pinnochio’s menu into your data","",""

Web applications use different HTTP methods when accessing URLs. You should familiarize yourself with the HTTP methods as you work with Flask. By default, a route only answers to GET requests. You can use the methods argument of the route() decorator to handle different HTTP methods.

from flask import request

def login():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        return do_the_login()
    else:
        return show_the_login_form()
If GET is present, Flask automatically adds support for the HEAD method and handles HEAD requests according to the HTTP RFC. Likewise, OPTIONS is automatically implemented for you.","",""

I'm trying to iterate over the CSV and insert into my db . It works when I do other test insertions so there is a connection.

This is the relevant code - it's basically the same as in the lecture.
```

f = open(""books.csv"")
reader = csv.reader(f)
for isbn, title, author, year in reader:
    engine.execute(""INSERT INTO BOOKS (isbn, title, author, year) VALUES (:isbn, :title, :author, :year)"", 
            {""isbn"": isbn, ""title"": title, ""author"": author, ""year"": year})
```

I have gotten it to work using a different type of insertion, but I think it's really unsafe practice to do that as it doesn't protect against sql injections - and it breaks when the book titles have apostrophes.
```
engine.execute(""INSERT INTO BOOKS (isbn, title, author, year) VALUES ('{}', '{}', '{}', {})"".format(isbn, title, author, year))

nope. First, I assumed that user already logged in and then rendered a member area page. right at the point of logging in, you'll set the session global variable and right on the member area page, you can then query for that session variable from another route. like ```# Inside the route to retrieve session data. if session[""id""]: return jsonify({""ID"": session[""id""]})```","","👌🏻 (1)"

Search: Once a user has logged in, they should be taken to a page where they can search for a book. Users should be able to type in the ISBN number of a book, the title of a book, or the author of a book. After performing the search, your website should display a list of possible matching results, or some sort of message if there were no matches. If the user typed in only part of a title, ISBN, or author name, your search page should find matches for those as well!

so I started using git and followed what happened in lecture-0.
now we are in lecture-1, talking about branching. So brain has already lecture-1 ready with `test` file. And demonstrated how branching and adding `feature` branch - make changes separately -- isolated -- in a branch and then merge if satisfied in `master`

I didn't have code ready, so basically I made new directory of lecture-1 copied the lecuture-0/ hello world - html page in that as `test.html` - changed line from `hello world` to `this is line added in master` - saved it. followed up with `git add test.html`,  `git commit -m ""created test.html"" `

Now I created branch feature as per instructions, moved to that branch with `git checkout feature` added new line `this is line added in feature branch` - saved it. didn't add - commit yet. Checked in which branch I am in with `git branch` moved to master with `git checkout master` opened `test.html` and it has both lines 😮 the line I added in feature as well. I didn't add,commit,merge or anything in feature, just added a line and saved.

How is this getting auto-merged by default? How can I stop auto-merge feature if it's by default on? 

Tried both in pycharm, vscode -- same results. Os: win10, terminal: wsl (bash shell) -- 

Any help would be appreciated. TIA","",""

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.

lastly, if user sign-out in another tab, you can use the above method to make sure that the session object still contain data(in case user try to access the app from another tab) if it doesn't have valid data(empty session for example) return JSON error which you'll use as a trigger on the client side to redirect to login page","",""

remember that it all begin with the server. it flask session is missing - then it doesn't matter what other module save a copy.

1/ I'm debating whether to use

I've dived in to the documentation and noticed it has a namespace/room attribute/function.

I could just emit an array with room,user,message from the client and sort it on arival back at the client,  muting the ones not in the active room (but saving them in a dict server side) and loading them with ajax from the server when a person changes room. As anyone can see everything anyway.

As far as I can tell there is no ID as to where messages comes from unless you put one on it (room id). So if someone is in a room together they will both recieve the message and unless i mark it with a room its not possible to see were its from?","",""

This helps mitigate an annoyance with how the refresh command is implemented in web browsers. All the web browser does when you hit the refresh key is to re-issue the last request. If a `POST`  request with a form submission returns a regular response, then a refresh will re-submit the form. Because this is unexpected, the browser is going to ask the user to confirm the duplicate submission, but most users will not understand what the browser is asking them. But if a `POST` request is answered with a redirect, the browser is now instructed to send a `GET` request to grab the page indicated in the redirect, so now the last request is not a `POST` request anymore, and the refresh command works in a more predictable way.","","👍 (2)"

filename = ""../../../../home/username/.bashrc""
Assuming the number of ../ is correct and you would join this with the UPLOAD_FOLDER the user might have the ability to modify a file on the server’s filesystem he or she should not modify. This does require some knowledge about how the application looks like, but trust me, hackers are patient :)

@thunder ,  are you talking about some books in the result not having covers? I actually used a different API for that, OpenLibrary. And they don't have all the book covers that's why they are empty.

 I also used OpenLibrary for the covers,  but yours is much better as the searched books come with a cover image making the search experience great.
One advice: Your image for the detailed book page could be of better quality, using OpenLibrary API

`:id` here is actually whatever you wanna call it. You can use a different name for it like `id = :user_id`.

The best approach I believe for creating the Menu model is to have all the menu items(Pizza, Salad, Dinner, etc) stored in one table, seperate tables for toppings, Size, addons.
I however made seperate tables for all menu items- Pizza, Sub, Salad ...I would suggest to try the former method, not mine.

One table for everything on the menu sounds nice. Like add a category field to distinguish between menu items? But how does it look in the admin page?

 ```like add a category field to distinguish between menu items```
Yes that is how some other folks worked it out, just one Menu table. 
The benefit of this method is if tomorrow you as Owner of restaurant come up with a new Menu category like noodles, then all you need to do is add another category-noodle, in the Category table, and  then add different noodles in the Menu table. The other method  of separate table sucks here as we will have to create a new table for noodles. 
```I'm not sure it's user-friendly to look at especially for restaurant owners who would manage the site```
Yes admin page would become difficult to manage with one Menu table.  So that is the benefit of separate tables method😀","","👍 (1)"

In particular with this line:
books = db.execute(""SELECT * FROM books WHERE LOWER(:search_option) LIKE :search_value"",
                            {""search_option"" : search_option, ""search_value"" : search_value}).fetchall()

SELECT * FROM books WHERE LOWER('title') LIKE '%whatever%' 
instead I'd like it  like this:
SELECT * FROM books WHERE LOWER(title) LIKE '%whatever%'

I was trying to look into using escape characters but haven't been able to figure it out, any help is greatly appreciated 😃

I know I could use an if statement for each option, but I think it would be more consise the way I tried it, and there's probably a simple fix somwhere out there.","",""

Say your app defaults to a channel called 'general' when a user visits/registers for the first time so `name` has a value of string 'general' and `channel_list` is `null` because there's nothing there yet. `null` is of type object.

`channel_list` would then evaluate to an empty array `[]` based on your code. So I can't see where that `2` came from. `console.log` should evaluate to the string:
`""channel list is ""` 

With `channel_list.push(name)`, `channel_list`'s value is now the array `[""general""]`. But the problem is with array's `push` method. It returns the *new* length of the array not the actual array. So `updated_list`'s value is now `1` which is the length of array `[""general""]`.

I suggest you simplify it like this for the rest of the code:
```
channel_list.push(name);
localStorage.channel_list = channel_list;
```

There's no need to convert it to string with `toString()` in the end since local storage converts the array to string automatically.","",""

`a` will only be recognized as a variable if you write it as `:a` and  then use a  python dictionary to indicate what `a` is.
Ex:
```books = db.execute(""SELECT * FROM books WHERE tilte LIKE '%:a%' OR isbn LIKE '%:a%"", { ""a"": a } )```
Now you have the SQL command saying that `a` is a variable  and the python library ` { ""a"": a } ` informing who is `a`.

On VSCode, there is an extension called 'Live Sass Compiler' that will automatically watch and update your css file, and another called Live Server that let you see your webpage in real time as you make changes. 

It also includes 'Emmet' that let you use shorthand macros to quickly write html and css. Per exemple, you can type 'ol>li*5' and it will automatically create an ordered list of 5 list items.

I have been searching for hours, but I can't find the solution. I am trying to install the psycopg2-binary package (Project 1: Books). This is the error message:

    Error: pg_config executable not found.

    pg_config is required to build psycopg2 from source.  Please add the directory
    containing pg_config to the $PATH or specify the full executable path with the
    option:

        python setup.py build_ext --pg-config /path/to/pg_config build ...

    or with the pg_config option in 'setup.cfg'.

    If you prefer to avoid building psycopg2 from source, please install the PyPI
    'psycopg2-binary' package instead.

    For further information please check the 'doc/src/install.rst' file (also at
    <http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/install.html>).

This error has been posted before (in this chat and elsewhere), but none of the suggested solutions worked for me.

The pg_config file is in the PostgreSQL package, but the idea behind the binary package is that I don't have to install these other packages.

I'm on Windows 10. On a different pc I had no issues installing the package.

Any ideas?","",""

"639130979117563942","Matt_D#6491","08-Nov-19 01:01 AM","A variable can be thought of like a box that contains information.  You can set variables in your “local environment” (cmd prompt in Win and bash for Linux).  The thing you stuff in the box in this case is text.  You define it by saying [set MY_VAR=text] minus the brackets.  Why? The Path variable allows you to add shortcuts, for example your python program is buried in some long c:/filename that would be a pain to type in each time so we set the python.exe long filename equal to your path variable and now you only need type in python from anywhere and the computer will look at a list of environmental variables (which can be accessed with the set command) and go to the path you defined.  Sort of like a shortcut on your desktop isn’t the program, it’s a “link” to where the program is buried.  We can hold other info in our variables as well like a long Heroku database URL.  So if we set DATABASE_URL=Heroku:usernameandtherestoftheaddress (with no space around the 🙂 then python can read that environmental variable and you get to just type in DATABASE_URL (provided you do the proper python imports as provided in the examples) instead of copying and pasting the value over and over.  As is the use of variables.  The idea is to “keep things dry” as in do not repeat yourself","","👍 (1)"

you can make the pages about anything you want, the only requirement is that you meet the tech specs.
github doesn't compile anything. you need to download and run sass to convert your .scss file to .css, and upload both of those to github. remember the browser can't read .scss files.
anything you put in readme.md will appear on your github repo page.
you need a youtube channel yes, but you don't need to talk. just demonstrate your project's functionality

Probably not the best solution but it works. Now I want to store that theme so that it is associated with the user. Do I add a data structure to the application.py that keeps track of which theme the user has chosen (or not) or do I add the current theme as session data or is there yet another way one could do this?

if I build Website on Front-End (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap) and after learning Python/PHP/Node.js if I start implementing it on the Front-End then it'll be complex and messy to implement or what ?

For the parts that do change you'll want to identify which will be created by the server and which will be changed by the user's browser.

The parts that will be changed by the browser you can leave alone.
The parts that will be changed by the server will need to be replaced by your python/PHP/Node.js code.

For the moment you could probably use div tags to mark the sections that might be changed by the server.","",""

I django, typically apps are kept separate, you shouldn't need to link apps together.  I haven't spent much time in django 2 but in django 1, you should need `url 'cart:cart_add'` since you don't have any namespace collisions in your urls.  You should just be able to do `url 'cart_add`","",""

It is required that each message in chat channel should have a timestamp. If you are chatting with someone located in another time zone as compared to yours, it is natural for you to see all messages, both yours and his/her, with timestamp of your own time zone. Correct?
So, the good idea would be to store timestamp of each message at server-side data structure at UTC format, and then, as messages have been delivered to all users, they should be adjusted to time zone of each such user based on his local time zone? Correct?

If you want to return something, you have to write it on the same line as `return`. Here are two ways to do it based on your example:
```js
function myFunction() {
  return { name: 'Bob' } // return this object
}

function myFunction() {
  return {  // start of something to return
    name: 'Bob' 
  } // end of something to return
}

// Original
function myFunction() {
  return // return what? (undefined) function terminates, ignores the next lines
  {
    name: 'Bob' 
  }
}
```
So, be careful with your indentations.","","😀 (1)"

Since each time you go to the shell script and work with your app you have to set env variables as FLASK_DEBUG, DATASE_URL, FLASK_APP, you can make it in one step. Here is the procedure (this should work in MacOs and Linux):
* make a new file in the same folder of your application.py, name it w/e you want, i just called mine `vars` witout any extension.
* inside the file, you write something like this:
```
#!usr/bin/env bash
export FLASK_APP=application.py
export FLASK_DEBUG=1
export DATABASE_URL=whatever_your_database_uri_is  #replace with database uri.
```
* to run this file, you type inside your terminal:
`source filename` OR `. filename` (note that there is a space after the `.`)
* You can check the current environment variables by running the command `printenv`

This way, you can forget about your database uri, and just run that command everytime you gonna run your flask app, or better said, everytime you close and reopen that terminal. environment variables live inside your terminal, so you need to set them each time you open a new one.","","👍 (1)"

In your `requirements.txt`file, modify Werkzeug line to this
`Werkzeug==0.16.0`
This is a known issue with Werkzeug 1.0.0 Version, you can read about it here: https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-python-webapp/issues/16
Now, you have multiple ways of doing the workaround:
1. execute `pip uninstall Werkzeug` , modify `requirements.txt` file, then run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Start from scratch in a new virtual environment, then run the second command above, after modifying the `requirements.txt` file.

Always remember to create a new virtual environment before working with flask: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/#installation","","👍 (1)"

> * make a new file in the same folder of your application.py, name it w/e you want, i just called mine `vars` witout any extension.
> * inside the file, you write something like this:
> ```
> #!usr/bin/env bash
> export FLASK_APP=application.py
> export FLASK_DEBUG=1
> export DATABASE_URL=whatever_your_database_uri_is  #replace with database uri.
> ```
> * to run this file, you type inside your terminal:
> `source filename` OR `. filename` (note that there is a space after the `.`)
> * You can check the current environment variables by running the command `printenv`
> 
> This way, you can forget about your database uri, and just run that command everytime you gonna run your flask app, or better said, everytime you close and reopen that terminal. environment variables live inside your terminal, so you need to set them each time you open a new one.

@Doukasss For project 1 combination of Adminer and Heroku looks like the easiest way - you don't need to learn any extra stuff. For sure, hosting PostgreSQL database locally is possible. In order to operate with it using python you will have to install psycopg package - https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/ and read its manual. It involves additional efforts.

@Yiannis11 i think you are focusing your efforts in the wrong subject. If you took cs50 you understand what means ""the right tool for the right job"". It turns out that C is actually pretty good to learn some concepts, like strongly typed languajes (if you want to be a software developer, this is a must), data structures, algorithms, memory allocation, compiled, interpreted, runtime, etc.  I took cs50 with no prior programming experience, and found C as powerful as it can be, due to it's verbosity. some subjects like OOP would be better to be learned using Java because you cannot just print ""Hello World"" in Java without using OOP (class main). 
Maybe you just want to do high level stuff, but that's not the case of everyone. I like to understand what i'm doing, whats under the hood, that's why i found cs50 and particulary C, very explanatory. If you want to dive in JavaScript, at least you know the syntax, thanks to C. Curly braces and semi-colons are the main headache of many developers out there 😁","",""

Assuming you have installed postgresql locally, and you have created a role (new user) called `john`, a database called `johndb` , and granted all privileges of said database to that user, the connect string would be like this:
`""postgresql://john@localhost:5432/johndb""`
If you have created a password for that role, see the example above.
If you don't know what's hapenning:
1. https://computingforgeeks.com/install-postgresql-12-on-ubuntu/ install and configure postgresql 12. Steps for postgresql 10 doesn't include adding new repositories as they are in default ubuntu repos.
2. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3582552/postgresql-connection-url Connection URL help.

@olaf passenger is the class, name is the atribute so doing passagem.name you are accessing the atribute name from the class passenger. doing passenger.name.flight_id doesn't makes sense as there is no atribute/method inside name","",""

1.  You can set environment variables through your operating system.  Doing this will keep it set on your computer until you go in and delete it.
2.  You can set it inside python's runtime environment.  When the python shell/script/program stops the environmental variable will disappear.

I like the second method because I don't have to worry about any cleanup  my system or get environmental variables confused across projects.  If you do go this route, remember not to hard code passwords and keys in your python files -- they'll be open to the public once you push to github.  Instead, read them from a file that sits somewhere far away on your system.","",""

2.  Next, make sure your client and server are talking through the same socket.  You can have each print a message when they send or receive a signal.

1. You create two versions of the navigation bar, one with the layout for wide screens and the other one with the layout for smaller screens, then with CSS `display` property you hide one and show the other depending on the screen size with media queries

2. Using one version of the HTML for the navigation bar, writing the code in a way that changing the CSS will affect the sizes, maybe using `position` and `margin`. This one is slightly more complex and you may need some experience with several different CSS properties to get it to work","",""

```

1. When screen size is wide, make `ul > li` render horizontally using `display: inline-block`
2. When screen size is small, make `ul > li` render vertically using `display: block`
3. Tweak margins and paddings to fit the rest of the layout
4. Use `position` to make further adjustments to the positioning of the dropdown elements. For example, instead of doing the hover → show effect with `display: (block|hidden)` you can do `position: absolute; top: -9999px; left: -9999px` to get them off screen, and so on","",""

As a sanity check, you can also use another web browser.  If things work very differently, it's probably time to clear caches again.  Also, restart your web server.

Sometimes, the web server process doesn't want to shut down.  Try closing all your browser tabs and windows first.  The server might be so busy trying to talk to a client that it delays the kill command.  If that doesn't work, go ahead and close the window your server is running in.  You can also go kill the process (use Task Manager for Windows machines, ps --kill for linux).","",""

`sqlalchemy.exc.DataError: (psycopg2.errors.InvalidTextRepresentation) invalid input syntax for type integer: ""year""

LINE 1: ... author, year) VALUES ('isbn', 'title', 'author', 'year')`

This is my models.py:

`class Book(db.Model):

id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
isbn = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)
title = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)

year = db.Column(db.Integer, nullable=False)`

I know year is a string and in my model ins a Intenger but I cant do int(year) for some reason.

Can you help me? Thank you.","",""

On 1 July 2020, **CS50W on edX** will be updating to a new version, so if you want to finish the course as it currently exists, try to complete it before that date! If you haven't completed the course before that date though, not to worry, we will be able to give some credit for past work completed. More specifically, if you have completed:

* Project 0, you'll be given credit for Project 0 in the new version of the course.
* Project 1, you'll be given credit for Project 2 in the new version of the course.
* Project 2, you'll be given credit for Project 3 in the new version of the course.
* Project 3, you'll be given credit for Project 4 in the new version of the course.
* The Final Project, you'll be given credit for the Final Project in the new version of the course.

Project 1 in the new version of the course has no prior equivalent; regardless of where you are in the course, if you have not finished CS50W prior to 1 July 2020, you will need to go back and complete that new project.","","👍 (3),❤️ (1)"

> export DATABASE_URL=whatever_your_database_uri_is  #replace with database uri.

> * to run this file, you type inside your terminal:
> `source filename` OR `. filename` (note that there is a space after the `.`)
> * You can check the current environment variables by running the command `printenv`

> This way, you can forget about your database uri, and just run that command everytime you gonna run your flask app, or better said, everytime you close and reopen that terminal. environment variables live inside your terminal, so you need to set them each time you open a new one.
@Coroto Hi, I have tried everything, from creating .sh, .env files to your method of bash files but the variable `os.getenv(""DATABASE_URL"")` is always `None` When using locally such as 
```
export foo='bar'
```

```python
import os
os.getenv('foo')
OUT> 'bar'
```

The values are working, but not for the script file where the return value is `None`","","👍 (2)"

```html
<form>
  <input type=""text"" name=""something"" placeholder=""Something"">
  <!--Add some other form element here-->
</form>
```
and in Django, you can get it like this:
```python
if request.method == 'POST':
  something = request.POST['choice']
```
So you don't need to use AJAX or by passing form variable in Django template.

```python
with open('./books.csv', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as f:
  # create a new csv reader
  for row in reader:
    # execute native SQL code
```
Maybe that would help to avoid the error that you are generating. 
Or if you are insisting using sqlalchemy, probably you can `str()` everything first before you substitute in, because I think Python interpret ISBN as an actual number rather than a string.
(BTW, I saw in your `__repr__`, you have four placeholder(`%s`), but you only substitute three value, probably that's another error?)
Hope this helps.","",""

Announcement
> 
> On 1 July 2020, CS50W on edX will be updating to a new version, so if you want to finish the course as it currently exists, try to complete it before that date! If you haven't completed the course before that date though, not to worry, we will be able to give some credit for past work completed. More specifically, if you have completed:
> 
> * Project 0, you'll be given credit for Project 0 in the new version of the course.
> * Project 1, you'll be given credit for Project 2 in the new version of the course.
> * Project 2, you'll be given credit for Project 3 in the new version of the course.
> * Project 3, you'll be given credit for Project 4 in the new version of the course.
> * The Final Project, you'll be given credit for the Final Project in the new version of the course.
> 
> Project 1 in the new version of the course has no prior equivalent; regardless of where you are in the course, if you have not finished CS50W prior to 1 July 2020, you will need to go back and complete that new project.

@RomanBlade have you implemented this? In application.py, I'm passing a list of messages to a channel.html template. However, I don't know where to apply some JavaScript code to convert the timestamp to a local date-time string.
```<ul id=""messages"" class=""list-unstyled"">
  {% for message in messages %}
  <li>
    <strong>{{ message['display_name'] }}</strong>
    {{ message['text'] }}
    <small class=""text-muted"">{{ message['timestamp'] }}</small>

Here, `message['timestamp']` is an integer.","",""

@Timo Yes. As I read docs for date object in JS It turned to be much easier than I initially thought. I keep timestamp of each message at server in javascript date format (number of milliseconds).

Need a little bit assistance i've got model of books and responded API values from goodreads as a diffrent value. I do special list for a ratings and for the counts. I've got inner loop in my jinja2 what i can't hold by logic because it returns for each 'cards' what whole list not a single item. Using jinja2 in HTML file i put a loop inside a loop. There's also diffrent idea to mutate list of objects returned from the database to add rating for each and counts for each from API's but i don't know how to mutate object on class models witch is using ORM's SQLalchemy property to get new list of object with ratings and counts. So what is exacly my question. It's about hot to render from list for each books(already for loop used on details title/id/author/year) to add a (single rate)","",""

I want to clarify a requirement for Project 2: Flack. Does the application demand that:

1. 2 (or more) people can open the application at the same time in different browser windows and chat with each other without reloading the page, or

2. it just demands that 1 person can open the application at a time, but when the application is opened in different browser windows, then all windows must react the same way without reloading?

I thought the first option unlikely, because Display Name must be stored in localStorage, and localStorage stores variables across browser sessions, meaning that there could only be 1 value of Display Name at a time. However, I'm not so sure.

Your help will be much appreciated, thank you!","",""

I have unique styles for all 4 my linked pages.
1) Do I basically copy my <style>content</style> (within my html file) into the scss file ??? (Basically, do I use the scss file as if it is my <style> content in the html file ?
2) Do I only use scss for styles I want to have consistent over multiple pages ?

3)git seems to struggle with scss...how do I load/push/pull/compile scss then ?

4)Do I use #id .class in the scss, or is it not necessary ?

I would really appreciate the help, I need to finish this before the new update on the 1st of june","",""

I recently submitted Project 2 - Flack for CS50 Web, along with the youtube video demonstrating its functionality, through EdX. Unfortunately when my grade was released to me the project has been marked 0/1. I believe that the project met all the requirements (with some extra functionality as well), however perhaps I missed something. I haven't seen any comments on the grade email or on the submission itself to help guide me as to what was missing.

I'm wondering how I should proceed - redo or update the project, and resubmit it through edX?

Thanks, Paul","",""

This error is usually when the terminal cannot find a file or directory you entered . It's probably because of a misspelled word.","",""
