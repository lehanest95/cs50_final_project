||""Given the pair of candidate indexes (winner, loser), you need to be able to check whether there is already a path in the graph (represented by the matrix named locked) that starts with an edge leading out of the node for winner and ends with an edge into the node for loser.

You can assume that the graph has no cycles because your program is never going to create one. So the graph already has a path from winner to loser only if there's a direct edge from the former to the latter, or there's a path from winner to some third node from which a path to loser exists. This recursive definition of ""path"" in the graph suggests an implementation of the check that lock_pairs needs to make.

(and later she wrote:)

""Uh-oh. I should have said that when considering the pair (winner, loser), lock_pairs wants to check whether a path already exists from loser to winner, not the other way around.""||

If you are worried about the challenge being spoiled i can assure you it's a vague enough hint that i still feel very satisfied.","",""

could someone take a look at my lock_pairs + cycleCheck functions: https://www.codepile.net/pile/Ja5gmp3q

I have read all comments here and a reddit post that explained lock_pairs function really well: https://www.reddit.com/r/cs50/comments/ejzqhh/pset3_tideman_locking_pairs/

However, it seems like I have a bug somewhere. It seems like I am skipping pairs where I should be locking them: 
If I run Tideman with the example from the video: 
votes: 
2x A C B 
2x B C A
1x C A B
My locked pairs matrix looks like this: 
0 1 0 
0 0 0 
**0** 1 0
and I should be getting:
0 1 0
0 0 0
**1** 1 0
I *sometimes* feel like I am very close to the solution. :)

Cleaned code:
||void lock_pairs(void)
{
    bool cycleCheck(int winner, int loser);

    for (int i = 0; i < pair_count; i++)
    {
        int pairsWinner = pairs[i].winner;
        int pairsLoser = pairs[i].loser;
        if (cycleCheck(pairsWinner, pairsLoser) == false)
        {
            locked[pairsWinner][pairsLoser] = true;
        }
    }
    return;
}
bool cycleCheck(int winner, int loser)
{
    if (locked[loser][winner] == true)
    {
        return true;
    }
    for (int j = 0; j < candidate_count; j++)
    {
        if (locked[loser][j] == true)
        {
            cycleCheck(j, winner);
            return true;

I don't think you need to create your own array (unless you are implementing a merge sort in `sort_pairs`).

You can initialise arrays like `int scores[MAX][MAX] = {{0}};` for a stack variable, or use `int (*scores)[MAX] = calloc(MAX * MAX * sizeof(int), 1);` instead of `malloc` (equivalent to `malloc` and `memset`ting it to all zeroes)

1. `sizeof` returns the size in bytes, not array elements.
2. You would have to compare to the winner so far, so `if (x[j] > x[winner]) { winner = j; }`
3. Most importantly: This is totally useless here, because you are simply meant to find a candidate that is not the loser of any locked edge.","",""

Local variables (this time an array declared in `main`) are not initialised implicitly, so the initial value is any garbage that happened to be in the same memory location when the array got declared, likely from some previous call to any function.
So when you print the elements of `ranks`, you get whatever was there in memory.
If you implement it correctly, after all the `vote` calls, the `ranks` array should be all set up, no element left at its initial value.","",""

@Tovarish Something I found of use was to use printf after each function I created which helped with 2 things: 1) the function is indeed behaving in the way I wished it to be 2) subsequent function failures are independent of this one.  Also, I found that creating a copy of the code so far and hardcoding some values helped in reducing the amount of time required to test certain functions e.g. instead of typing 
./tideman a b c
Rank 1: a
Rank 2: b
Rank 3: c 
etc

- A **path ** is represented between **two nodes** or **candidates** and is __checked first__. I represented this with a yellow dotted line going from candidate **b to a**.
- If no **path** exists between candidate **b** & **a** - draw a path between **a** & **b**.
- Due to the nature of the graph, we can't check for a direct **path **between candidates **2 **& **0**, so we must do this by checking if an edge exists between them via candidate 1

- In this example, when checking if a **edge**already exists between nodes **2** & **0**, we see one __does already exist__ (via node 1) 
- So we __don't __want to draw a **path **between nodes **0** & **2 **, because it would make a cycle (Of edges?).

__Base case: __

- It'll take in the **pairs[i].winner **from lock_pairs as it's first paramater, we could name this **""start""**
- It'll take in the **pairs[i].loser** from lock_pairs as it's second paramater, we could name this **""end""**
- It then first checks if a **Path **exists between the ending node (**the pairs[i].loser**) to the starting node (**pairs[i].winner**)
- If it **does** find a path between the ending node (**the pairs[i].loser**) to the starting node (**pairs[i].winner**), it'll return some kind of bool value, to indicate a path **does** exist between these two nodes for **lock_pairs** to then use.

__Recursive case:__

- Once the base condition above has been checked and does not evaluate to **some boolean value** to indicate a path exists between the ending node (**the pairs[i].loser**) to the starting node (**pairs[i].winner**),
- You can **loop through** all possible starting nodes (**pairs[i].winners**).
- It'll again check if an **edge **exists between between the ending node ((**the pairs[i].loser**) but this time, also every possible starting candidate represented by **locked[i][]** ) to the starting node (**pairs[i].winner**)
- **If an edge does exist** between this **starting node**, and **ending node**:
- Your **check_cycles** function will **call itself again**, it'll pass the **starting node** being looped through with ""**locked[i]**"" as the **""start"" parameter**. It'll pass back in the **ending node as the ""end"" paramater **(this remains unchanged) 
- This allows it to **""Draw through""** all of the nodes in the graph one by one and recursively check if **an edge exists between two nodes that may pass through other nodes.**

Like the base case can check if an edge exists between two nodes anywhere but it can only do that with the help of the recursive function to loop through and first check if that edge exists between all possible 2 nodes in the graph first.","","‚ù§Ô∏è (1)"

Hey @SiNiStRo , yes, just create a textfile with 3 A B C A C B C B A (each in a seperate line without spaces, just as you would enter manually) where 3 is the number of voters. Choose whatever you like but make sure to add more ballots if you have more number of voters. As well if you have more Candidates üëç  once done, start your code like this
```./tideman A B C < textfile.txt```

@Sniperdown04 This is a tough question indeed.  I think it helps to watch the walkthrough more than once to fully understand the problem.  
You don't need to jump into coding it right away...

This is kinda cheezy but I made up a quick anagram to remember some key steps when tackling a problem. ** UBER**.

Understand - fully grasp what the exercise is all about.  Watch the walkthroughs. Don't code yet.
Breakdown - split up the question into small chunks and plan out how to solve what each one is asking.  You can use pencil/paper, make diagrams etc
Execute - write and test the code just for the small section you're doing.  debug it or printf to test your code.
Review - review what you just wrote and how you might use the result for the next part of the exercise..","","üëç (1)"

@!Tempesto hello!, I did that already yesterday, but my problem now is with the next function which is record_preference. It takes ""ranks"" as an argument and only that, so how am I supposed to know which position of the ""preferences"" array I have to increase by one? thanks in advanced","",""

So ranks[0] is first preferences, so if candidate 3 is first preference then the value ranks[0] should = 2.
For preferences[i][j] imagine that position i is the current candidate, and j is who you're comparing them against. So I checked them starting from the best. So the i in preferences[i][j] I made ranks[i] instead. That way the candidate I'm checking against everyone is the first preference.

@AK  what the preferences array does is, it records how much one candidate is preferred to another one. So preferences(i)(j) means how much candidate i is preferred than j.

i've changed my function multiple times, checked it thoroughly, still yields errors. 
i entered cs50's github and tried to understand where does my error come from (based on knowing what the check50 function does) and, even though the output of my function is the same as the one needed, the check50 function still yields this error
i've wondered whether the error comes from the fact that i didn't implement the sorting algorithm myself (i've used qsort), so i tried implementing bubble sort myself
it works, but still this error occurs

Rank 1: Bob
Rank 2: Alice
Rank 3: Charlie,
then have the ranks array printed, it ought to print out as 1 0 2, because that's how it's being entered (as you said), but a loop with ranks[i] prints it as 0 1 2, instead.

Preferences is also a bit confusing, as it seems like it is asking for something like:
1 beat out 0 and 2, and 0 beat 2, so given how my particular function is implemented, preferences should read [[1, 0], [1, 2], [0, 2]] (for this one voter), but then it goes on to *also* want that same information in the form of a whole new struct.

Seems redundant, is all, so I'm worried that I'm missing something about the fundamental workings of the algorithm.","",""

i had a hard time with each function initially to understand how they are meant to be displayed. as in what information do i need to put in each ""entry"" if an array of a variable.
not sure how to better explain it.
i guess alot of it had to do with me not using the same numbers as in the example on https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/3/tideman/. but rather using my own numbers.
(i just tested both their numbers and my own on each step)
then i used their example with bob alice and charlie. and just kept trying different ways of displaying it untill it matched what was in there.
ofc later on it confused me as they gave 2 different examples with the exact same amount of candidates and their names.
so i kept getting things mixed up on all the different papers i had with those names trying to understand it. lock pairs had me going for a while tho.
prolly gonna keep all the papers i wrote on tideman somewhere as a sentimental memorial of my mental sanity.","",""

a>b = lock
take new pair b>c
a>b>c = lock b>c

There was a mistake in my sort algo which  still passed all the tideman check50 stuff. After doing it by hand everything now matches up with what I would expect. So first apologies for any confusion, and second here is how things were locked again with the sorting fixed. The locks are in order of what was sorted. I believe you will agree with this output now.

They teach people to weld by teaching stick rod first (it's more complex).  Takes a little longer, at first, but by the time you have moderate capacity with it, MIG and flux-core are a breeze--which works out, 'cause MIG and flux-core wire and shielding gas are more expensive than most stick rods, practice inch for practice inch.

When writing out your code for tideman be sure to treat every function as its own function. What that means is do not create gloabal variables that a function puts stuff into that the next function would rely on.

check50 uses tests to test each function on its own. They provide the data necessary for that function, and check the results. That means if your code relies on global variables that the cs50 staff don't know about then your code may fail even if technically it is right. check50 is not using the your codes results for the next function to test!!!

When writing tests for code. The idea is that you test each function by itself. That you do not rely on other functions to be correct to prove what you are testing works. This removes the posibliity of what is called ""test pollution"" where your test fails for code that works because other code you aren't technically testing is wrong.

Anyway. Maybe long winded. Just wanted to pass this on to hopefully help someone else who is wondering why their code is failing when it should actually be working.

Maybe the cs50 @staff can confirm this thought.","",""

Yes.  This is why the spec explicitly states that you cannot modify anything other than the function implementations themselves (although you can add other functions/headers as needed).  
> You should not modify anything else in tideman.c other than the implementations of the `vote`, `record_preferences`, `add_pairs`, `sort_pairs`, `lock_pairs`, and `print_winner functions` (and the inclusion of additional header files, if you‚Äôd like).

I realize how to do it on paper or in my head, but, for instance, in a recursive case, what is the case?  I can't figure out what to compare to.

I have arrays of winner/loser pairs and margins populated and in decending order, but no matter how I do it, the indeces to compare to are passed and are unusable in current comparison.","",""

    {

The idea here is: the index for the pair that ""wants to lock (but needs to check if there is a cycle)"" is the input i. ""origin"" is also this original pair's index.

Then, I'll check if the loser from that pair locks to anyone. When I find someone who it is locked to (defined by ""k""), I'll do that same process for ""k"", always checking if the one ""k"" is pointing to on the recursion is the original point. If it is, a cycle has been created.

@flyme2bluemoon The fact that you have two loops running already does that. Think like this:

For every ""i"" candidate, you are comparing it to every other candidate through ""j"".

Let's suppose you have** i =0**.
You go through the entire ""j"" loop and **preferences[i][j] > preferences[j][i]** is **false**  for every test (which would mean candidate ""i"" doesn't win over no one).

Now, ""i"" is going to increase one, since you finished the nested loop (j).

When i is passed to your forloop function, that is the original winner, and you are correct in your logic as far as I see in checking if that original winner loses to anyone else. The issue now is you are only checking 1 level deep in the chain of winner to loser. Or 1 step further. 

There should be some way of keeping hold of the original winner to look for, but continue checking further and further, winner to loser into that chain. Which is why recursion is implied in this case. It is possible to do this itteratively, but I don't suggest it.

So what would a recursive function need to know to check the next link in the chain, so to speak? You got the original winner there. 

Once you know the things the recursive fuction would need to know. When should it stop checking, or what is the 'base case' to stop?
