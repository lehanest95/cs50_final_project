The question is, on line 15, we are practically defining Espacios as the result of the subtraction of UsuarioEscribio-Espacios-1, and the condition given is that if Espacios is greater than 0, then it will subtract.

My question is, suppose that the user in his input defines UsuarioEscribio as 8, above we already have a for loop that defines Fila as 8 as well, as we have attached it to the UsuarioEscribio value. It is not supposed then, that the loop for Espacios, is 0 (8-8) and -1 would be -1, why then this works?","",""

Fila is strarting out as 0 (it literally says Fila = 0), goes through the first iteration (everything between lines 15 and 23) as 0, then changes to 1, goes again, etc until it's 8. When it's 8, it's equal to UsuarioEscribio, so the condition for ending the loop is satisfied, and the program goes to line 25, bypassing lines 15-23, straight to the end of function","",""

I'm having some issues returning a 0 or 1 value to main. 

In my first function I am able to return the value and use it in main. In my second however I am not. I'm guessing it's because the return is in brackets within brackets - but I'm assuming there must be a way to return the value within the if / else statement to main.

Thanks so much for your help !

int \*arr
you can write arr[x] which means \*(arr + x)
In your example, you go with backward direction
int (\*arr)[size]
you can now write something like arr[x][y] -> \*(((int\*)arr + x\*size) + y). Because arr points to array of size elements.

About syntaxes. I could imaging only one case, when you should use it: when you know number of elements in row (columns) and don‚Äôt know number of rows (for example it comes to your function as an argument).

You should also pay attention that you may request a huge unbroken sequence of bytes from system. That may be impossible (even if you have enough free-memory in total, read about memory fragmentation - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management).
To overcome this issue (at least partially) you can use 2 dimensional (pointer-to-pointer) approach
int \*\*arr;
arr = malloc(R \* sizeof(int \*));
for (int i = 0; i < R; ++i) {
    arr[i] = malloc(C \* sizeof(int));

I would say that you implemented Stack. I mean that newly added element is becoming ‚Äúhead‚Äù of your list. So you can rename ‚Äúadd‚Äù to ‚Äúpush‚Äù and implement ‚Äúpop‚Äù function to complete.

If you are interested, you can check queue-structure implementation in glibc (spoiler, a lot of macro‚Äôs): https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob_plain;f=misc/sys/queue.h;hb=HEAD","",""

    if (argc < 2)
    {
        printf(""Usage: runoff [candidate ...]\n"");

    printf(""hello, %s\n"", answer);

        printf(""Wow, you are old\n"");
    } else {
        printf(""Congratz, you're still young\n"");

Basically the if statement was not inside main function, and also it is not ```c
if int (age <== 10950)
``` but instead ```c
if (age <= 30) //removed int since we are not assigning a value to a variable, also changed <== since specification says it is supposed to be <= and also changed 10950 to 30 since i assume we are checking for a person with age >= 30 years

I started by trying a easy one: looking at all elements of the array, and finding the smallest one:

```c
#define size 4

int main(void)
{
    int array[size] = {4, 3, 2, 1};
    
    int minval = array[0];
    
    for (int k = 0; k < size; k++)
    {
        if (array[k] < minval)
        {
            minval = array[k];
        }
    }    
}
```

So now, that's great. But, when I'm trying to find the next smallest value, how do I avoid the one I already have sorted?","",""
