The idea of passing a function to setState (vs. just an object with the properties you want to set) is that that you can capture the current state at the moment when setState executes.  I believe React batches setStates so you can't  be sure exactly when they'll execute.  Certainly not necessarily by the time you get to the next line of code.  Anyway, so, instead of checking this.state.seconds in your if, you should do one  setState and send a function that takes care of everything.  So... you could do something like this:


this.setState( prevState => ( 
      if ( prevState.seconds == 0 ) ... return {minutes: 99, seconds:0}

A loop (unless inside a generator or some kind of stream thing) will execute each iteration of the loop ASAP.  I want it to wait and do in series.  There are several ways, but I'm curious if--in any of the lectures I haven't seen--if they show some built in feature of react-native or something that can help handle this.","",""
"208819301468209152","phillip#4197","24-Jul-18 08:21 PM","@MikeMK  I don't know if it's really correct to say tech is lucrative.  I do think though, with technology and software in particular (because it's basically free), the potential to bring huge value or  return on investment.  If I got paid based on how much money my customer made/saved I'd be retired by now.  But, if I can help make my customer rich/save money then they're happy to overlook any of my deficiencies.  For example, if can help deliver a product that will start saving a tour bus company $100,000/month in fuel costs, the customer will not care if I know the right CSS for something or other.   So, my point is software can have these huge variances between what it costs and what it pays back.  Of course, I've seen several projects with tons of funding turn into zero value--so there's that too (maybe that's why I don't charge based on customer profits).  

Anyway, from reading your comments my only ""advice"" (please only take it for what it's worth) is to maybe try a multifaceted approach to learning all this.  Personally, using the vocabulary in real live speech with others (or chat on computer) is huge for me.  Trying to teach others is great.  I wrote a few books and taught Flash back in the day, and most of the time I was needing to learn what I was going to teach only days before teaching.

render(){

I gives you a nice standardized way to handle all ""actions"" so it's not like I'm architecting an event system every time.  Also, it helps avoid the desire to make deeply nested components ""talk up"" to their ancestors.  One idea to help think of a project is to find an API out there that you'd like to play with.

RE: redux resources, the docs are great https://redux.js.org/ and I just notice this very good video series is free: https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux     If you go through one of those 4 minute videos and you're anything like me, it could take you an hour to feel like you have a clue what's going on.

 I'm using Firebase for user auth. The user adds their wallet, and they get stored to a Firebase Database. Then I'm trying to have Firebase Functions intercept them and do 2 things:
1. Add previous transactions (via etherscan.io API or similar, I'm open for suggestions)
2. Subscribe to new transactions, and send to Firebase Cloud Messaging to handle push notifications. I've been trying to use web3 or dagger https://matic.network/dagger/ (which as far as i can tell just also uses web3...) to subscribe to new transactions on a wallet, and I can get it to work fine in node on my computer, but I'm confused about how to integrate it with Firebase Functions, or if I should be using something other than Firebase Functions, and also whether subscribing each wallet of each account like this is scaleable. I can wrap my head around the Firebase Cloud Messaging and Push notifications flow, but I'm having trouble finding materials that talk about using web3 or something like it to handle subscribing to transactions in this way.

If you have any advice or can point me to some materials let me know.","",""

To get more of native API you need to switch to more advance which React Native gives using this expo components thing. But if you really want to have your playground where things are in good shape then go for traditional environment - Native(Java/Swift) that gives you more flexibility but then again React Native is my preference as I believe in one-shot-to-implement-idea.

To be eligible for a verified certificate, you'll then need to complete the course by 30 June 2020. Thereafter, the course will no longer be available for a verified certificate from edX, but the course will remain freely available as OpenCourseWare indefinitely.

this might be a very stupid question but I am really confused right now :/
I completed project1 - pomodoroTimer (2018 session) and I am really confused how to actually submit my files this time. The instructions say the following:
""Using Git, push your work to https://github.com/me50/USERNAME.git, where USERNAME is your GitHub username, on a branch called mobile50/projects/2019/x/1 or, if you’ve installed submit50, execute...""
First of, installing submit50 seemingly doesn't work because windows doesn't support it (or something like that), so had use Git. I am very confused by Git Bash and even after some research I still didn't quite understand it. In the end just manually created the branch on the GitHub website and uploaded all the relevant files (for project0). This registered on the CS50.me website so I hope it works (grading is pending).
This time I wanted to do the same but GitHub doesn't allow me upload all the files in the folder in which I run my App via Expo Cli (expo creates hundreds of files). What should I do now? Just upload the JS flies or has someone good instructions how to push via Git Bash (I think I actually tried it properly and it gave me the same error that some folders can't be uploaded...)

Any  help is much appreciated 🙂","",""

It's quick and you are good to go. I am afraid importing the project 1 folder would be more problematic, I am also not sure if all the components in project 1 folder are necessarily up-to-date, it's been 2 years since they were published.

@suhana Writing the code is the main part of the assignment, so this is where you have to think about your solution. In other words, you have to find a way to: 1) ask user to input the todo when they click the button and store this value (so find a way to get the input) 2) create a function or sth that will create an element (like a list or anything else you feel like doing) consisting of the text of todo and a checkbox (so find a way to add something to the website using JavaScript) 3) make counters tracking the items and unchecked boxes (so think about what would cause the number to change).","",""

The main work must be done in script.js, this is where all the important stuff goes into. You should edit this file with your solution using editor of your choice (like Visual Studio Code, Notepad++, Sublime Text etc.), because it will be much easier that way (in theory you could probably do this is MS Word or sth).
