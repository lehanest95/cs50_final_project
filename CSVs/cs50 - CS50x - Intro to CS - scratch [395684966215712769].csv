Create a variable, give it a name, and then it will ask for a scope (what can access it, all scripts or just this script). Once you create the variable you get more blocks that allow you to set the value, increment the value, and or show or hide the value in the window.  For example, you can create a ""Score"" variable, and anytime something good happens in your game you change the Score by 1 or whatever value.  You can use it as a switch too, like a light bulb, set 0 in the variable for off, and 1 for on, and you can use IF blocks to check if the variable is 0 or 1 to decide what to do.","",""

- What does it mean when it mentions I should probably use a few dozen puzzle pieces?

They aren't complicated to draw, but more complex that I want to grind through on the built in drawing program. I've googled around and I can't find the required image format (I did see one place say bmp, but in playing around it's let me upload a jpeg). I look at the tutorials and they seem very incomplete, they will say things like ""let's pick a background, I'll pick this one"" but it's not one that's there for you to choose and there is zero information about how that background was created.

@Anne Harrison 
I've started CS50 2x already and haven't yet finished (a little thing called LIFE intervened...). I haven't yet done the Scratch module, not becuase I can't, but because I felt the same way you did. But in the end, it is just a stepping stone to get the ball rolling towards **THINKING **logically. Maybe you can take your idea, simplify it somewhat, and then put it together. 
If the Scratch module were an art class, a watercolor would be just as good as the Mona Lisa - at least that's my thought and take on it :)
Good luck","",""

@Yaroslav 1.  if you want it to appear, be sure to tick the box next to its name in the Variables list.  2. your 'if ball touching' block will only happen after the 10 second glide finishes. (the block before).","",""

@curiouskiwi I just start the ball at (x;y) and then I want to glide it towards the Earth. While gliding I want to able to touch and kill the ball with the rocket.

@Nelson I think it has something to do with using the bullet as an object instead using only the clone to do the stuff you want. If you check my project you can see I only have code for the clone, while the main object remains hidden and unused. This part I stole btw from a guy from Youtube. So I'm just an imposter 😉","",""

-  create a list (kind of like a javascript array) containing all the messages the fairy will have (click ‘create a list’ in variables)
- make a `counter` variable (or whatever u want to call it) and set it to 0
- then set up a ‘when space clicked’ event that displays __item `counter` in <message list name>__
    that’ll be something like **say** (item `counter` in `messages`)
- after you displayed the message, increment `counter` by 1 so it selects the next message when space is clicked again

if this seems a bit confusing, (sry i’m probably not the best at explaining things XD) I’d encourage you to google __scratch list tutorial__ or something like that","",""

Basically the cat needs to change costumes based on the costume of the fish that she touches. The fish falls from the sky and if the fish is normal she is supposed to switch to a happy face and if the fish contains a “hidden” pill she is supposed to look mad.
The way the code is now the cat looks happy no matter what fish she eats. I have tried every combination I can and it will not react to the second costume of the fish. I even added a variable for the fish costumes but it didn’t do anything. I would like to avoid making a third sprite for the fish with the pill, if possible.
I am new at this and any help will be appreciated. Many thanks!","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/395684966215712769/700731156630601818/scratch_problem_2.JPG",""

I want to explain the rules of the game I'm making in the beginning in such a fashion that the ""host"" says a line, then waits until the player presses spacebar, then says the next line, and so on, five lines total. 

Whatever I do, the moment I press spacebar, every line is triggered simultaneously, which results in only the last one being shown on the screen. How do I make it so pressing spacebar simply triggers the next line, not every line?

Grammatically, you should use ""fish"" as the plural of ""fish"". EG ""Nice you got me 10 Fishes"" should be ""Nice you got me 10 Fish"".
The choice of yes/no doesn't respond with y or n. 
I'd suggest giving the user instructions on how to fish.
The person needs to know to click on the fish to catch them.
I tried moving my mouse over and hooking the first 5 or so fish not realizing I needed to click.

You will need a broadcast system. Make the code as when the player touches the wall, broadcast a message for the player. When the player receives the message, they are set back to the original X and Y position. Hope this is helpful and makes sense 🙂","",""

@PortobelloPirate oh, okay, thanks a lot! So, when it comes to the same subsets of code, all unconditional scripts work before conditional(e.g. if), right?","",""
"153965724711256064","PortobelloPirate#1091","30-Apr-20 07:03 PM","Not quite. In your original program, the Wait function is *technically* occurring after the conditional, but because the conditional is false when Scratch isn't touching the goblin it was constantly waiting for one second. So when Scratch *does* touch the goblin, the code had to finish the Wait function to get back to the conditional statement

In other words, let's imagine the code was:
```When Green Flag Clicked
    Forever
    {
      If Windak says ""Hello.""
      { 
       Say ""Hello""
      }
      Sip Coffee
    }```
I'll keep sipping coffee until you say ""hello"" to me because the Sip Coffee function is after the conditional. But:

```When Green Flag Clicked
    Forever
    {
      If Windak says ""Hello.""
      { 
       Say ""Hello""
       Sip Coffee
      }
    }```

If the Sip Coffee function is in the conditional, I'll only sip my coffee if you say ""Hello""","",""

So guys, this is a personal project I already had half-done, and I decided to recycle it for week 0. 
Hold space to shoot (but take care with the heat bar), the turret aims to the mouse pointer. Click only once the starting ""play"" button or stuff will start to break right there. 
Can you play it and tell me where does it break (it more than probably will)? Thanks in advance!","",""

"534785044321927171","Bunkeror#9322","02-May-20 03:05 PM","OK, I give up. My brain is going to melt. 
Let's see if I can explain this well. 
I have an improvised ""cinematic"" where two characters have a conversation. Each character's mouth is an invisible ball sprite, so there are two sprites having a conversation. As it is... Well, a conversation... Each one must only start speaking when the other has finished. 
I thought I could so sort of a walkie-talkie thing. As Scratch doesn't have yet a ""wait until broadcast"" block, I made two custom blocks; ""over"" and ""over and out"", and a general ""over"" variable.","",""

"534785044321927171","Bunkeror#9322","02-May-20 03:10 PM","The algorith is: when the previous dialogue ends, the ""over"" variable is set to 2. When the next one starts, the sprite that speaks first can do so right away. The other one finds an ""over"" block. As the variable is 2, it sets it to zero and waits for it to be 1. Meanwhile, the other one finds its own ""over"" block. As the variable is now zero, it sets it to one and after a delay, it waits for it to be one again. Why? Because during that delay, the other one has passed the ""wait until one"" phase and has set the variable to zero and continued speaking. Then it finds its own over, sets it to one, the other one sets it to zero and speaks... And so on. When ""over and out"" is called, it sets the variable to 2 and just lets the last waiting ""over"" to finish without doing anything.","",""
"534785044321927171","Bunkeror#9322","02-May-20 03:11 PM","Now, the problem is... It doesn't work only when it's the second ball the one which speaks first. I don't know why, because the custom block is the same in both sprites. The variable changes quickly from 2 to 1 to 0 (which... I mean, the code does what I tell it to do, be it wrong or right, but I don't think I have told it to do that) and then both start speaking at once, ignoring the stops in each over block.","",""

Think of a broadcast as a guy with a megaphone saying something so that the whole game can hear it.

The event ""Receive <message>"" then triggers when the other parts of the game hear it.

You get out what you put in, if you're familiar with C and computer programming it'll only take you a minute to do that.

If you're familiar with coding but not C, it might take you a little longer (like it did me a few days ago) whilst you get to grips with the new syntax

@karanksl Hi @karanksl, 
You could probably make the dog slower or faster depending on the score. Or you may be able to make a scrolling game and make the story about the ball and include many obstacles. Alternatively, you could make the ball faster or slower depending on the score.","",""
