But then, i also need to do the same kind of logic in the IBAction for the button, so it toggles when the Catch/Release button is tapped.

> To start, add a new boolean class variable that keeps track of whether or not the Pokémon is caught. If a Pokémon is caught, change the text of the button to something like Release, and vice-versa when it’s released. 

I added a class variable `var isCaught: Bool?`  in `PokemonViewController`, and toggling catch/release works while I'm on some Pokemon's screen. But if I go back to the list view and tap the same Pokemon again, the state is reset and the button always goes back to ""catch"". Am I supposed to save the `isCaught` state somewhere else?
