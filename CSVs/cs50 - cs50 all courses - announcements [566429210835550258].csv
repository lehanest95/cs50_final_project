**30 NOVEMBER 2019**

Hi all, if considering taking CS50's Mobile App Development with React Native, aka CS50M, via edX, be sure to register by 30 November 2019 at https://cs50.edx.org/mobile. To be eligible for a verified certificate, you'll then need to complete the course by 30 June 2020. Thereafter, the course will no longer be available for a verified certificate from edX, but the course will remain freely available as OpenCourseWare indefinitely.

Because mobile app development is evolving so quickly, the current version of the course is increasingly dated. A new version may take its place, but no timeframe for such just yet!","","👍 (47),👌 (10),🤮 (6),😂 (6),🥚 (4),😭 (2),💩 (1),❤️ (1)"
