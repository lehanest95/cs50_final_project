"403626422016671744","jason#9686","27-Jan-18 06:41 PM","integer division is great for giving you the number of coins: 
`32 / 25 = 1`                  `7 / 10 = 0`              `7 / 5 = 1`              `2 / 1 = 2`         ==>          `1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 4`
modulo is handy for giving you whats left : 
`32 % 25 = 7`               `7 % 10 =  7`            `7 % 5 = 2`          `2 % 1 = 0`    

so just using these two things , you should be able to complete this without having to have a loop for each coin value,
in fact, just using this integer math , you could give the answer in about 5 lines of code
which although quite succinct probably wouldn't be worth submitting....","","👍 (1)"

Let's say the change was 68.  When you divide by quarters, you'll get 2 quarters.  But your next step, you then divide 68/10 and you'd get 10 dimes.  But you've already ""used up"" 50 cents, so you should only be checking for 18 /10 to give you one dime .. and then 8/5 for one nickel, and then 3 pennies.

When i tried to use roundf it cut off 4.2 to just 4.  i'm not sure what i did wrong, i had floatc=roundf(n) where n is my input from the user.

"501447931325579285","L-Hopital#9298","20-Mar-19 12:05 AM","I have question regarding an integer overflow I keep getting in the cash problem. When I test my code with various $ - trying to trigger certain While conditions I see that when a particular while condition is not satisfied, its contents still runs and causes an overflow. Within a particular *while condition* (which wasn't satisfied) I have a variable defined within which gets calculated  - for exampled  **int q = Change/25** -  although my condition to calculate this was not satisfied, it nevertheless gets calculated and prints out q = 2358239486752345, or some other random big number. 
Any suggestions on what I might be doing wrong?
many thanks","",""

2) instead of having my total coins calculated at the end, I can instead have a rolling sum of coins within each While clause, therefore the code will never need to ""go back and find my q"" since the while condition necessarily forces (or in this case, not force) an addition for q to find the total coins.","",""

Won't happen since `arr[3]==1` and that one will always have `remainder==0`, but compiler won't know. Place some `return` after your loop. I'd use `return 0;`, and remove the `if (remainder==0)` and `if (centsChange==1)` tests, as they would no longer be needed. But that extra code won't hurt.

Your recursion is essentially just summing up. The loop could do that without recursion, using a `numCoins` declared before the loop, and a single `return` at the end of the function.

`remainder/100` will do integer division. `remainder/100.0` would not. Integer division rounds towards zero to result in an integer again.","",""

I think the videos you mentioned should have covered such things (I've watched them a previous year). Depending on how you approach it, the code can be pretty compact and still readable.
`credit` is a lot more to do, with more complex conditions, that's why it's advertised for those ""more comfortable"". Not much harder (assuming you manage to do the Luhn maths by hand), mostly a lot more you might get lost in. And harder to keep it readable.

1) I really wanted to solve this using modulo operators, but in the end I had to give up on the idea out of frustration because I just couldn't find out how to make them work elegantly here 
2) if you go the ""traditional"" way, using loops, the hint video seems to be saying that 'while' loops are the way to go, but I was only able to make this all work using 'for' loops instead (thanks to the Mario problem); I fear I don't really understand how while loops are supposed to work. My 'while' loops just ended up repeating infinitely, an issue I don't have with 'for' loops
3) even then, I feel like my 'for' loops are unoptimized and/or that I don't understand the notion of scope in C all that well.  I had to copy/paste a specific line within each of them to get the calculations right, and I feel bad every time I copy/paste something lol.
In the end, my program is about 45 lines long if you remove comments. Does that sound like a lot?","",""

@SomeRandomGuyNextDoor Each function has its own set of variables, it's sort of an autonomous object.

However, if some customer is owed $9 exactly, assume that your program’s input will be `9.00` or just `9` but, again, not `$9` or `900`.

float f == given by user, x is an int variable to print at the end. 

1.  ask for the amount of change needed.  If that number is over .25, minus .25 from f, add 1 to x, and repeat until f<.25 and move on to the same process with .10, .5, .1..

end by displaying x.

You could keep subtracting each individual quarter, but is there an operation that will let you know how much change remains after all the quarters are gone? Combine that with division and you can cut each coin to two steps, one to find out how many of that coin type, and one to find the remaining change.

Also, I think it's recommended to multiply your change by 100 so that you're dealing with ints instead of floats, but it's your ballgame.","","🍴 (1)"

There is a function `fmod` in `math.h`, but in this case, it makes more sense to work with integers, to avoid imprecision issues (what looks like a short number in decimal, e.g. `0.4`, might be an infinite number of digits in binary, so the value stored is an approximation).","",""

"324522780252962816","Sinergy#7605","19-Mar-20 10:10 AM","@ayokaaye hm there are a few things.  To start with, the reason we calculate cents is because floats are imprecise.  Their magnitudes are a good representation but, especially after taking them away from each other multiple times, you can get errors from that imprecision.  So the idea is that you record cents as an integer using 
```int cents = round(change * 100);```","","👍 (1)"
"324522780252962816","Sinergy#7605","19-Mar-20 10:12 AM","and then subtract from the variable cents to record changes as you ""give back"" each coin type","",""
"324522780252962816","Sinergy#7605","19-Mar-20 10:22 AM","I can see that you've changed over your method for calculating but you haven't altered a few things and your logical path through the code is a bit off.  As it is now, if your change required is >= 1, then it will calculate how many quarters are required within that if statement, and then won't run any of code in the else just below it.  You kind of have a mix of loop and direction calculation.  You also have your calculation of cents within an if statement for no particular reason.
On that, you have a couple of options for how you manage each coin type.  You can calculate how many of each is needed directly like you have for the quarters.  If you are calculating using ints, then it will round down.  e.g.  53/25 = 2.  99/25 = 3.  This is exactly what we want for this problem.
However, I'd suggest you try to do it with loops because that's one of the more complicated things in week 1.  In Mario you are doing exactly the same thing within each loop.  Cash gets you thinking about maybe doing something different each loop.

I've tried not to give too complete of an answer.  I'm happy to answer any more direct questions you might have.","","👍 (1)"

this is part of the code and the rest with the same logic on this logic sometimes it runs okay and I can see the printf sometimes it doesn't

for example when I use .41 it won't work right the code won't enter the 4th condition and the change will be 3

but if I use .61 the code will execute right and I will get 4

I firstly solved the problem without this problem bc I was multiplying in 100, -25, -10, -5, -1

but now I don't multiply and -.25, -1, -.05, -.01

The `if (value >= ...` are not required.
You also wouldn't need separate `coins_q` and so on, at least not if you used the `%` operator instead of subtraction. Subtraction with multiplication might be a little bit faster than remainder, not sure (division is most complex operation, though for binary it's easier than decimal).","","👍 (1)"

But there are things talked about in the problem that you haven't properly added yet (the things it mentioned about int and float, and the round function).  As Blauelf mentioned, you should only be using a float for the input, then convert that to int and only use int variables from then on.  As far as what you're doing...  the f%25 that you have in your code, even if it were valid and f were an int, it is calculating  f%25 and then not doing anything with it.  The f is not being changed by this statement.  You might for exampe do
```int coins = 63    //Just picking a number at random
int remainder = coins % 25```

First of all, careful with posting your bits and pieces of code here, apparently you should use the tag SPOILER in your message. Not sure how to do it as I've never posted code.

First thing I notice is that you're converting dollars to cents by multiplying per 100. In the exercise's walkthrough Brian talks about using the round() function to make sure it precisely rounds it to cents.

Also naming your variables with short names for what it does might help clear it up.","",""
