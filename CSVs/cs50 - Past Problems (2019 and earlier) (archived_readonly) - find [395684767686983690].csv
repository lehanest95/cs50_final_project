If it doesn't, start using `debug50` (explained in week 2) and follow your program to see where it might be failing.

"393854278764068875","curiouskiwi#1671","24-Nov-18 11:51 PM","so you have a counting array that holds the number of times each value in your original array appeared.  So let's say your counting array looks like this: ```{1,0,1,4,2}
 0,1,2,3,4   values``` which means you have 8 values in your original values array.  You now need to loop over the counting array and replace those 8 values in the original array with the values in sorted order.  So, value[0] would be 0, value[1] would be 2, value[2] would be 3, value[3] would be 3, value[4] would be 3, value[5] would be 3, value[6] would be 4, value[7] would be 4.
