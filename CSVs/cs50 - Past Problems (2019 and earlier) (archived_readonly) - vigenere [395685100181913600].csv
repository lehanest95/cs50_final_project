"395861528521474048","thesillygeek#1343","28-Dec-17 11:24 AM","Hey the problem with my code is that to reject 1 command line argument having non-alpha characters( eg ./vigenere 45 ), it asks the user for plaintext. If I cut paste the get_string to a later part of the code, then i can't define the array size m.

Please go through the code and other general tips are welcome as well, as i am a newbie :)
Thanks in advance.

:( encrypts ""world!$?"" as ""xoqmd!$?"" using ""baz"" as keyword
    expected ""ciphertext: xoq..."", not ""ciphertext: xoq...""
```
For keyword `baz`, plaintext `world!$?`, I get `ciphertext: xoqmd!$?B`. Using eprintf to see ciphertext iterating it is shown as `ciphertext: xoqmd!$?+B`.

My problem now is that I can enter plaintext but cipher is always blank, prompting me again for text. I think the problem is how my key array is incorporated, but I'm not entirely sure if key should be an integer array or a character array. When I parse the key array, I use the (key[l] - 65)%26 (or 97). I put this value back into the key array. When I debug, it doesn't show values in my key array so I think this is where it goes awry, not sure though.","",""

"482243659077779476","lemonparade4#0318","06-Sep-18 11:13 PM","Hi, all -  I have vigenere like 85% correct. My problem has to do with looping the key. My code works perfectly until I get to the end of the key string, then it wigs out. I thought I had figured out an easier way to do the loop than what was suggested on the walkthrough - basically, I have the counter iterate every time the key string character is applied and then I reset it to 0 whenever counter = strlen(key string). Check it out (unless doing so would violate the academic honesty policy :-)):

       https://pastebin.com/WRPpi4WJ

So when I use the ""I love you""/panda example from the walk through, it does the first seven  characters correctly (and I can see the j counter reset like it's supposed to using debug50), but it suddenly starts putting gibberish starting with ""y"". The printed Ciphertext is ""X lvne o"" (instead of ""X lvne noh"") and debug50 says that the string is ""X lvne \210o\202.""  The only thing I can think of is some kind of scope issue where the enciphering functions aren't receiving the reset j value? (Note: this snippet probably won't work correctly if you copy-paste because I left out the part where I capitalize the whole key string to make enciphering easier).","",""

I was hoping someone could review my code for vigenere. My question has to do with returning values to main.
Normally, return 0; will indicate the program was successful, and return 1; (or any non-zero int) will indicate something has gone wrong. 
But what do you do if you want to return 0; and return 1; from a function you have called? 
 
For example in vigenere, I have coded the procedure for checking whether the provided key is purely alphabetical chars, and the program should return an error if it isn't. If it is purely alphabetical chars everything should go ahead. How do you do that from a called function? Ideally it would look like the picture, but of course that doesn't work because I'm just returning 0 or 1 from the called function to an int that I should declare in main, right?","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/395685100181913600/568499532992741376/SPOILER_unknown.png",""

"143459351212851200","mr pickles#8813","21-Apr-19 06:47 AM","The issue is the way you are writing:
if (isupper(c) == true)

I'm not sure why it's wrong, but it is. I THINK you're basically using the double = to check whether the output of the function islower(c) is  literally completely equal to the integer 'true'. That obviously makes a bit of a mess. I could be wrong with the explanation, but this is definitely where the issue is.

anyway to fix:
Note that the functions isupper() and islower() return a value of 0 if the char does not fall into the specified class (the class here being an uppcase or lowercase letter), and a non-zero value if the char does fall into the specified class. You can read this by typing 'man isupper' or 'man islower' in terminal.
Also note that in C, all non-zero values are equivalent to true, and 0 is equivalent to false.
So if you just write 

if (isupper(c))
{
    // Do something
}

if the char c is uppercase, your statement will look like ""if (true)"", because isupper returns a non-zero value, and the if tree will execute.","",""

I declared a string ciphered as plain.

Mainly to escape a lot of errors when tring to stuff the converted characters vrom plain into a new string.
However when trying to see what was going on I saw that even though I only put the converted characters into the ciphered string the original ones in plain are also converted. 
I take this to mean that string ciphered and string plain are referencing the same string.

How can I initialize a string (charcter array) withe the length of plain?
If I try to just decrare string ciphered;
It gives me null pointer errors when i say ciphered[i] = ' some char'","",""

Inside the loop, first calculate the current key from the current keyword character (`'A'` and `'a'` become `0` and so on).
Then add code to increment the keyword index after letter encryption, but not after copying over non-letters.
And make sure the index wraps around. Could be done for example with the `%` operator, or with an `if`.

But main() can send some data to shift() and also receive some value from it. It is supposed that this data is one character only. main() takes upon itself selecting this character from argv[1]. The work of shift() is converting it into a number. Looking from inside main(), the parameter is `argv[1][j]`. Looking from inside shift(), the parameter is `c`. shift() does not ""know"" anything besides `c` and does not do anything with it besides converting it to a number and sending this number back through `return`. So the only line in this code, that really belongs to shift(), is the one where 65 is subtracted from the value - but the value should be not `argv[1][i]` (because argv belongs to main()) but `c`, and it should be not assigned directly to `key` (because `key` belongs to main() too) but returned from the function (where main() would be able to assign it to key).","",""

However, it doesn't work the way I think it does and I am really confused. 

|| ``` 
// get the string length of the key as an int
 int n = atoi(argv[1]);
        //run this for loop a number of times equal to the string length
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++)

              printf(""%i\n"", n);
             //if any of the isalpha checks return a value of 0 print the text and return 1
              if (isalpha(argv[1][i]) == 0)

                  return 1;
              }
        }``` ||

the way I under stand this, atoi should give me a value equal to the length of the key. (ie if the key is 'key' it should return a value of 3) this would cause my loop to run 3 times and check each character in the key. But it doesn't ever run more than once.

But for example... a keyword of 3 characters, doing %3 will give me 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0.........
