On a table to store the symbols, I've setup a unique index on a column.
Then I'd like to use INSERT IGNORE to insert any requested symbol. In case it's a new symbol, database engine should create a new record. In case the symbol already exists, the unique index should return an error and prevent the insert. The error is IGNOREd by the database engine, and python code can go on.

1)Why in this problem its neccesary disable the cache?

2)Why the Cache-Control line have that three values? that for what I read and understand :

no-cache: means that a browser may cache a response, but must first submit a validation request to an origin server. This allow an origin server to prevent the reuse of certain header fields in a response, while still allowing cache of the rest of the response

no-store: means that that the browsers aren't allowed to cache a response and must pull it from the server each time it's resquested. This setting is usually used for sensitive data, such as a personal banking details.

must-revalidate: means that once the cache expires, refuse to return stale responses to the user even if they say that stale responses are acceptable. Is necessary to support relaible operation for certain protocol features

If these definitions are good, I don't understand why its neccesary put the three. I don't see necessary the no-cache and the must-validate value, becouse, how it will be validate a cache response(no-cache) if don't exist such cache becouse the no-store value? in the same way, how will must-revalidate not allow stale cache, if don't exist such cache?

3) This page ( http://cristian.sulea.net/blog/disable-browser-caching-with-meta-html-tags/) explain why its used these three lines of code:

    response.headers[""Cache-Control""] = ""no-cache, no-store, must-    revalidate""
    response.headers[""Expires""] = 0
    response.headers[""Pragma""] = ""no-cache""
So if I understand the first is in the case that I work with a HTTP/1.1 the second is if I work with a HTTP/1.0 and the last will disable the cache of a proxy . This causes me the question:

a) Is it the HTTP version 1.0 still in use? why? if have a new version!

b) If a disable the cache in the ""Cache-control"" and not in the proxy I will still have cache isn't? in the case that I work with some proxy .","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/395684754038456320/518463913373859857/unknown.png",""

You could, and in most cases it will work just fine. It's just that the automated code testers (linters) can choke easily on this, and in this case do. Being explicit here isn't a bad thing (it's probably better, more PEP20-ish). Other than that, what are you using that variable for? It sounds to me that it isn't needed at all (could be wrong here though), because it's related to the markup/html. Perhaps you can solve this with some Jinja instead?

Also, in my opinion your (register) code could be a bit more cleaner and verbose/explicit as well. For a small script like this, naming variables un/pw can work fine... but when projects get bigger it's probably better to use more readable variables (again PEP20: Readability counts). Where the error is coming from exactly I can't tell, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's from this line:
```session[""user_id""] = int(user_id)```
You're setting user_id to the variable user_id which in itself is an insertion into the database. So what exactly will be stored here?","","üëç (1)"

```session[""user_id""] = int(user_id)```
This sets a variable in session called user_id and sets it to the variable user_id (casted as int). Where does that value come from? According to your code:
```user_id = db.execute(""INSERT INTO users (username, hash) VALUES(:username, :hash)"", username=un, hash=hashed_pwd)```

If you don't have that,  `response` might be 404 but your program will just ignore that.   Run this little program to see how it works.  Comment out/in that status line and run it again.  See the difference?  ```python
import requests

try:

About `requests.RequestException` the documentation says: There was an ambiguous exception that occurred while handling your request.

And about `requests.HTTPError` says: An HTTP error occured.

I'm not so sure what really means ""an ambiguous exception"" , and the other hand, I see that resquests.HTTPError fit more in this case, in fact, I try to do this in the sandbox:

```def test():
    try:
        response = requests.get(""http://httpbin.org/status/404"")
        response.raise_for_status()

    except requests.HTTPError:
        print(response)
        return ""there was an exception""

    return ""It's okay!""

print(test())```

And gives me the same output that when I used `requests.RequestException`:

````<Response [404]>
there was an exception` ``

GET is used to retrieve data from a website (url) and do something with it, for example use that data in your core (application.py) and put it in a list or database for example. So you retrieve it from the url (user input) and it is sent to the server running application.py.

POST is used to retrieve ""html form data""  - so the same as GET but just for ""html form data""

I'm able to stop the submission in the case that /check returns false, however I'm not sure how to setup submit and preventDefault in a way that prevents the form submission and allows it in the right cases. As of now it properly prevents the submission, however a proper submission cannot  get through because of what seems like recursion with preventDefault. Any help appreciated.

Existence of `button` elements became standard in HTML4. They have opening and closing tags, so you can put stuff on them.
And to add to the confusion, now with CSS, you can style any element to look like a button. Screen readers might not be happy at all, depending on the actual code.

You could check in your browser's dev tools (F12), in the network tab, what the post data of the form actually is (you might have to tick ""keep log"" or similar), and in your Python code print `request.form` to see what this turns to.

My guess would be that the parameter is sent like `shares=` (no mention of a numeric type), and ends up in our `request.forms` multidict like `{'shares': ''}`.

`.get('shares')` or similar will return `None` if the key does not exist in the dict. Not existing key is different from empty string as value. But both, `None` and empty string `''`, interpreted as a boolean result in `False`.","",""

IEX has moved to cloud.iexapis. The new cloud IEX requires a token included with API calls. To get your token you need to go to https://iexcloud.io/ and create an account. It appears to be free but it looks like there are payment options for heavy users.
In helpers.py you will need to change the line in the lookup(symbol) function that makes the API call
OLD line:  ```response = requests.get(f""https://api.iextrading.com/1.0/stock/{urllib.parse.quote_plus(symbol)}/quote"")```
NEW line: ```response = requests.get(f""https://cloud.iexapis.com/v1/stock/{urllib.parse.quote_plus(symbol)}/quote?{token}"")```
You will need to store a token variable as token = ""token = YOUR TOKEN""
I stored my public token in the script which isn't ideal but I don't know that we can set environment variables in the IDE. Also, this is hopefully just a temporary workaround.
These changes are working and stock data is once again flowing back","","üëç (1)"

What is a primary key? It is just a unique identifier of that row (or record, in the language of databases).
The table positions, though does not need to have a primary key, because a position can be sold out. Thus a position, which is unique for each stock in each portfolio, just need to be identified with the so called foreign key, which is the primary key of another table. In my case, each position will be uniquely identified by the symbol of the stock and the user id, used as a foreign key.

`db.execute` might take a while to execute, so the next line seems to implicitly wait for the previous line to finish. This doesn't feel right, coming from JavaScript, where db.execute would be async, and the actual rows result be handled with a promise or callback.

"609528101441110016","NL-Kevin#4845","23-Dec-19 12:45 AM","Hi, are there any experts on Jquery here? My question has to do with the register form. 

I've disabled to submit button by default. Only if the user types in an username that is unique, the submit button is enabled. Otherwise, an error message is displayed and the submit button remains disabled. This I check ""live"" with a `keyup` function. 

Code works just fine, except when I type in an existing username real fast. Then somehow, the submit button is enabled instead of disabled.  It's almost like the browser is still catching up with the GET request to `\check` and therefore registers the incomplete name and does not respond correctly to the latest value entered as the username. 

For example, when I type in ""John"" (an existing user), In can see in the console that the JSONs are not returned in the order I typed, e.g. ""J"", ""Jo"", ""Joh"", ""John"". But instead the order of the returned Jsons is e.g. ""Jo"", ""J"", ""John"", ""Joh"". Which in that case causes the submit button the be enabled incorrectly, since the current value of field ""Username"" is ""John"" which is an existing user. 

I've pasted a snippet of my JS code below, could you please give me some pointers?","",""

In `/register` after validating the form fields, I do a select query to check if the username already exists or not. If the username exists I throw a error message to the user else I insert the data to db and logs the user in.

I have seen people suggesting the try catch method of validating this username thing.

Is `listofshares` a list of tuples (or lists or similar) of two elements? Like `[('AAPL', 23), ('NFLX', 42)]`?
Or is it a list of dicts? In that case, you would have go use something like
