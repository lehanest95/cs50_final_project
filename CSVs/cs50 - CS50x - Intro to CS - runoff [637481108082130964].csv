Thus, if voter [0] has top preference (also [0]) for candidate with index 2, you check if number 2 is eliminated, and if not - add votes. If candidate 2 is eliminated, look up voter [0]'s preference [1] and check if this one is eliminated. Stop once you've assigned a vote for this voter and move on to voter [1].","",""

What you want to do, is to initially set the variable containing the minimum vote to a high number.
```
int min = voter_count;

The reason is that you are interested in the lowest possible number, and by setting it initially high, you can then iterate through all the candidates.

Something like:
```
if candidate is not eliminated
{
  if (candidate[i].votes < min)
  {

I'm trying to loop through every first rank if it's not eliminated then I take it if it is then I take the next rank.
so if the first voter first rank is 0 (or what represents it by it's name) the program will loop through every candidate until it finds the one indexed 0.

Loop through the entire preferences array and give a vote to the first non-eliminated candidate for each voter.  Let's say you have 3 voters and 4 candidates.  So `i` will go from 0 to 2 and `j` from 0 to 3.  The first time through the loop you are getting preferences[0][0]  (the candidate that is top preferred by voter 0)  Lets say we store preferences[i][[j] into a variable called `voted_for` each time.  So if candidates[voted_for] is not eliminated, you increment the vote and then break out of the loop (so that you don't check any more candidates for voter 0).  Now you've moved to `i` = 1.   `voted_for` becomes preferences[1][0]  ... let's say that he's eliminated.  `j` = 1 now.  `voted_for` becomes preferences[1][1] ... and he's not eliminated, so we increment his vote.  break the loop so you stop looking at voter 1 and then `i` is now 2. you loop over preferences[2][0]  etc etc.    You're done once you've looped over all the voters.","","❤️ (2)"

"219956246927769601","thehorserapper#6794","16-Feb-20 10:26 PM","you don't need to loop through them all until you find the candidate.  Simply update the vote for the candidate that you have been given.   preferences[i][j] holds the candidate id.  Loop through the entire preferences array and give a vote to the first non-eliminated candidate for each voter.  Let's say you have 3 voters and 4 candidates.  So i will go from 0 to 2 and j from 0 to 3.  The first time through the loop you are getting preferences[0][0]  (the candidate that is top preferred by voter 0)  Lets say we store preferences[i][[j] into a variable called voted_for each time.  So if candidates[voted_for] is not eliminated, you increment the vote and then break out of the loop (so that you don't check any more candidates for voter 0).  Now you've moved to i = 1.   voted_for becomes preferences[1][0]  ... let's say that he's eliminated.  j = 1 now.  voted_for becomes preferences[1][1] ... and he's not eliminated, so we increment his vote.  break the loop so you stop looking at voter 1 and then i is now 2. you loop over preferences[2][0]  etc etc.    You're done once you've looped over all the voters","",""

I have completed 5 of the 6 functions, and they seem to work when i put in debugging print statements etc...but when I try to run it normal nothing seems to work. I can't seem to find where the problem is.

So I would like to post my functions one at a time and get some feedback. Maybe my issue is in my earlier functions and I just don't realize it.

Here is my vote function: My thought process was to update the preferences[voter][rank] each time a ballot came in. So I created a loop to go through each [rank] until i got to the candidate_count value, then iterate the [voter] and repeat until I got to the voter_count...

So, maybe there is something I don't understand. So the first vote comes in, and lets say it is candidate #2. name is passed to the vote function to check for validity. The for loop iterates i until it matches a candidate[i].name, in our case candidate[2].name. So now preferences[0][0] == 2. Then rank needs to be iterated so the next vote that comes in updates preferences[0][1].

I feel I am not conceptually clear.The question might sound dumb.                        We have declared preferences as a global variable containing  voter i and j preference.  so we defined above the limit as 100 and 9 candidates. we can have an array maximum of 100 rows (voters) and 9 columns (candidates).  but when we put  rank and voter in preference function (is rank and voter acting as local variable??) why haven't we initialized them to zero. I mean how would the computer understand that it is row 10 and column 8. how many for loops we should run??

Let's consider Voter Index 4 (the fifth voter). This voter has to rank the candidates. 


The first preference for this voter is `preferences[4][0]`, the second preference is `preferences[4][1]` and so on. 

Now, suppose that the first preference for this voter is Candidate Index 3. 

Then, 

`preferences[4][0] = 3`

I think the confusing bit is that inside the preference array there are not names but integers. this refers to candidates array, so depending in which order the user wrote the candidates name in the command line, that will be their index. So if my candidates are entered as ``` ./runoff Alice Bob``` Alice will be referred as 0 and Bob as 1.

I thought the if condition in the for loop would take care of it when only some candidates are tied too, but apparently it doesn't. My logic was that it would check if every vote is equal to the others, and only return true if every vote is the same.

@RichardFogaca shouldn't just checking whether a candidate is eliminated or not and then tallying up the votes do the trick? As the next functions will ensure if there is need for an elimination - candidate will get eliminated.","",""
