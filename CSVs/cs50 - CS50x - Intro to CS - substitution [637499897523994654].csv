When getting memory from the operating system, it usually is zeroed. So variables in a memory location your programme uses for the first time are kind of initialised to zeroes, it's just nothing you can rely on, leads to undefined behaviour if you do. Those are the kind of things that break if you change something in another part seemingly not connected, because suddenly this memory is not new, but reused, and has prior data in it.
Possible the checking environment caused the malfunction that way.
Later introduced tool `valgrind` would often detect using uninitialised data. I think that's in week 4, when topic is ""memory"".","",""

Oh and I did notice one issue with your code. Your code to check for repeating characters i don't think is case insensitive. So if some gives you a key with a lowercase 'a' and an upper case 'A' then I don't think your code would recognize that as repeating since they are stored in ascii as two different values. 

I would either convert your key to all upper or lower case before you check the validity or augment your code to account for the opposite case as well as same case letters","",""

@RoiSolomon no, argv is an array of arguments provided + the name of program (e.g. './substitution') at first place (so argv[0] contains string './substitution').

- In order to cipher my plaintext, I'd like to convert both my key and my input to uppercase (in order to be able to compare each character), then re-convert my input to lowercase characters (if any).
- To do so, I initialise a copy of my input, called storedInput, then pass my storedInput string to a function that converts to uppercase
- Unfortunately, when I do so, both my input and my storedInput are converted to uppercase (I understand this is because when you create a copy of a string, you actually create an array of char pointers to some allocated memory. Thus, input and storedInput both point to the same memory)
- I know that string.h has a strdup() function that returns a pointer to a new string which is a duplicate of the string. This should actually solve my problem because I could work on the duplicate without altering the original string.
- However, trying to compile with the strdup() function gives me this error : error: implicit declaration of function 'strdup' is invalid in C99 [-Werror,-Wimplicit-function-declaration]

Try thinking of the letters as their ASCII equivalents (pull up a chart for this problem set) instead of the letters themselves.  Then, you're going to need to perform manipulations on those numbers to get them all upper or lower case, first (as you can accept either upper or lower case key but shouldn't change output).  The trick is going to be that you end up with an array, based on the user input key, that is going to add/subtract some value to get to another letter of the ASCII chart for each position on the array.  In that way, your ""key"" is just a big array of numerical manipulations to your user input text.  Keeping track of upper/lower case and all of the filters to reject bad user input are also best accomplished with loops/arrays as well.","",""

I'm trying to copy over my array to a new array (just to loop nicer/rename it) using a for loop. I figure I should do it like this:

but when I do this, it adds a ""@"" at the end of the 26 character printf. But when I change the for expression to  for(int i = 0; i < 27; i++) it gives me the proper string with length 26. why is this?

Even further, if i change the size of the array and i < n to both be 23 or less, i don't get this @ symbol. but as soon as the array size and the condition for the for loop are 24, 25, or 26, it prints an @ at the end","",""

quick explanation - i used an array of booleans and an int as its index.
i calculate the alphabetical index of each letter from the substitution key (i.e. the letter e or E, which is the 5th letter, would be the 4th index).
when the loop finds a specific letter for the first time, its alphabetical index turns to true, e.g. when the letter 'E' first appears, lettersIndex[4] becomes true; if the loops finds the letter e or E again, it will see that location in the array is true and know the letter has appeared already.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/637499897523994654/700393546607493150/unknown.png",""

I'm running the part of my program to validate if the key provided by the user contains only letters AND if all letters occur just once.
I previously checked that the input is 26 characters long and only 1 command line parameter was provided by the user.
Unfortunately I get an error When I 
""run: ./substitution VCHPRZGJNTLSKFBDQWAXEUYMOv""
Segmentation fault
If I run it with debug50 it tells me: ""Process received SIGSEGV: Segmentation fault""
and shows at line:
"" if (! isalpha(key[i])) ""
that suddenly the variable i is  1565.
So totally above the possible range of the String does someone has an idea how to deal with this problem?
When I execute:
$ ./substitution VCHPRZGJNTLSKFBDQWAXEUYMOI
It runs just fine

So in a way each letter of the alphabet is either true or false based on its occurrences in the key. True where there is just 1, false when > or <  than 1.

What I understand is that you have to make another string of lower and uppercase alphabet and assign the key to those through using ASCII values but I still cannot figure out how this works, then apply that to the plaintext input to output the ciphertext.                                                                                               
The part that is really confusing me is if say for example the first few letters of the key are CZr... and you want to apply them to abc, or ABC respectively. I was told that I would need to take away either 65 or 97 (ASCII values for big/small A) from each char in the key BUT why is this when the characters of the key are not chars with consecutive ASCII values? I would understand that this could work if the key was e.g. XYZ or something, when the keys ASCII values and the alphabet you want to assigns ASCII values are consecutive so using a constant can work but when the letters are random, how does taking away a constant value assign the correct ASCII for the new char assignment? Hope this makes sense😫","",""

I still need to comment a bit but it's there.
However I'd like to try and make the key repeating check into a function, it just doesn't work.

My guess is that is that because instead of ""return 1;"" into the main function,
I have it as a variable in the function that's being returned into then main function,
and since the variable changes every time in the loop, that's why it doesn't work.

It work with checking the length of the key as there's no loop.
Any advice on how to do this ? Also any other comment on the code is welcome, if anything can be made simpler for example.

I separated each step of the validation, which made it much clearer and probably also why it was so confusing.
It's a bit of a long one to explain but now I got 
-a function that checks if there's one command-line argument
-another that checks it's 26 characters long
-another that checks if it's all alpha character
-another that checks if there's a duplicate

And it turned out that the problem was in the function that was checking if there was an alpha character,
I had to check first if the character WASN'T an alpha character rather than the opposite.

At least that's the way it worked for me

And also, for the duplicates, not need to check if lower or upper case, for example if the key has both 'a' and 'A', it should work. 

Which kind of makes sense...","",""

I think what really helps is to take the time to break everything apart, from the very first thing. The longer you prepare before getting into coding, the easier it will be to write.
Also a friend has advised to get the math done in an Excel sheet for example (or Google Sheets etc etc).
For simple math it's easier than having to print this variable or this variable.

Also try drawing things, like visually link each function to another, write it down as simple words. Then get the function.

For me it really helps breaking everything apart one step at a time.","",""

I think writing function, even if not needed, makes it much clearer. Then you have a program that says literally :
Check this, check that, now do this.
And it's much clearer for whenever you want to debug or someone else wants to debug.

But yeah it's a design choice I guess as well.","",""
