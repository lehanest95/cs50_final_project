"393854278764068875","curiouskiwi#1671","26-Apr-18 03:30 AM","Hi.  We changed the  source code this year, but it appears that the spec wasn't updated.  I'll make sure it gets fixed.  But essentially,  replace the `search` part with just this:  


This function is called by the typeahead plugin every time the user changes the mashup's text box, as by typing or deleting a character. The value of the text box (i.e., whatever the user has typed in total) is passed to `search` as `query`. And the plugin also passes to `search` two additional arguments, the last of which (`asyncResults`) is a ""callback"" function that `search` should call as soon as it's done searching for matches. In other words, this passing in of `asyncResults` empowers `search` to be ""asynchronous,"" whereby it will only call `asyncResults` as soon as it's ready, without blocking any of the mashup's other functionality. Accordingly, `search` uses jQuery's `getJSON` method to contact `/search` asynchronously, passing in one parameter, `q`, the value of which is `query`. Once `/search` responds (however many milliseconds or seconds later), `asyncResults` will be called and passed `data`, whose value will be whatever JSON that `/search` has emitted. The plugin can then iterate over the places therein (assuming `/search` found matches) in order to update the plugin's drop-down. Phew.","",""

```
Accordingly, search uses jQuery’s getJSON method to contact /search asynchronously, passing in one parameter, geo, the value of which is query. Once /search responds (however many milliseconds or seconds later), the anonymous function passed to done will be called and passed data, whose value will be whatever JSON that /search has emitted. (Though if something goes wrong, fail is instead called.) Finally called is asyncResults, to which search passes that same data so that the plugin can iterate over the places therein (assuming /search found matches) in order to update the plugin’s drop-down. Phew.```
But the `search` function looks like this:
```js
// Search database for typeahead's suggestions
function search(query, syncResults, asyncResults)
{
    // Get places matching query (asynchronously)
    let parameters = {
        q: query
    };
    $.getJSON(""/search"", parameters, function(data, textStatus, jqXHR) {
     
        // Call typeahead's callback with search results (i.e., places)
        asyncResults(data);
    });
}
```
There's no sight of `geo`, `done` or `fail`. Could someone look into it, please?","",""
"397677328660037632","Maarten#1004","26-May-18 09:25 PM","done and fail are part of getJSON (check the jquery manual for more on that). But the part of geo is indeed a bit confusing to read. It's basically referring to the geographical data that is being typed in the typeahead box.","",""
"210178498378072064","Atom Heart#5790","26-May-18 10:41 PM","But nothing is actually passed to `done` or `fail`. There's no use of them in the code at all. And the begginng of next paragraph sounds like there is:

""Notice that we’re using `getJSON`'s ""Promise"" interface, per http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getjson/. Rather than pass an anonymous function directly to `getJSON` (to be called upon success), we’re instead ""chaining"" together calls to `getJSON`, `done` (whose argument, an anonymous function, will be called upon success), and `fail` (whose argument, another anonymous function, will be called upoon failure).""

My intention is to use typeahead.js on pycountry library (https://pypi.org/project/pycountry/) so that when a user types his/her country they see suggestions and click on it. After that, in city section they can type their city again using typeahead.js but they can only see the cities from that specific country.

Looking at the source code of mashup, I can see the usage of typeahead but it's populated from a database. which we get from `/search` route and after that it returns JSON formatted matches. But what's the role of JavaScript here exactly? Or, the correct question might be, is it obligatory that I use a database to do this implementation? I can't simply use `pycountry`?

Unfortunately, as a reminder, be careful with the IDE, because I plugged in someone's working solution when I was trying to figure out why markers were not showing... Very similar to mine but I wanted to do a compare and contrast to isolate what my problem was.  Due to the IDE having a delay at times, especially on the GUI side, even when you hit refresh, MY CODE, which worked better, overall,  than the other persons solution I plugged in to see if a line is missing a line or even a symbol or something... magically is gone.  I have to redo the js again. Be careful.

Speaking of which @curiouskiwi  I could see the markers finally appear right before it snapped out of populating a map to an error, after changing from text to REAL for lat long.  That said, I have to write my whole file again... I'm so stupid but these things do happen... :","",""

(I think yes, but I'm more of an MSSQL background so there are differences)
Or should I recreate the DB for reasons I don't know but you'll probably know if there are any.  

Again  watch your ide, I took great pains to have copies of my code when I was checking what might be wrong.   I  think it was lat and long being text instead of real as I know see a flash of markers and a map before the page gets shut down to an error.  If I still had my own code, I think I'd be done.   The ide is on a slight delay...  always give things time.   Or you will be writing code you already wrote, again.  But it's sunday and I have the NFL Redzone and teams so... tomorrow,
