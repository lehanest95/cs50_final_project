- did you check if the function counts words properly? The way it is, I feel like you might be getting one word less because there's no space before first word (not sure, but it's worth checking)
- more importantly, the final result seems to be cast to int rather than rounded. Casting in C rounds floats down (e.g. 2.8 -> 2), whereas round() rounds to the closest int (e.g. 2.8 -> 3)","",""

||
(1) run one loop over the text string inside the int main(void) function checking each character and adding to three different integers (letters, words, sentences) each time depending on the character

or

(2) break each check out into three separate functions and run a for loop in each to check for the correct character. The count_letters function returns the number of letters, count_words returns number of words etc.

or 

(3) break out into one function, perform one for loop and return three integers (although I don't know if this can be done) ||

The problem set text hints at option 2 as it would make it more readable and int main is kept tidier. But I'm guessing it is pretty inefficient to run basically the same for loop 3 times.","",""

After verifying that the text is, indeed, text, calculate the amount of letters within the whole text, possibly with some kind of s[i] trickery.

Along with the calculation of the letters, the amounts of spaces required should also be calculated.

To add on to this, you might wanna denote a word being spaces++, since before a space, there must be a word! :D

Afterward, the program should look for a way to fit the newfound info into the Coleman-Liau index.

This will be done by multiplying the values assigned to the total letters and words by 100, and dividing them by the words/sentences when needed. For example, letters * 100 / words for L, and sentences * 100 / words for S.

Finally, after assigning these values, the L and S should be plugged into 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8, and print out that final answer with a ""Grade Level: %i"", ranging from Grade 1 to Grade 16.

1. Are `count_letters` and so on integers? If so, make sure to have a floating point division, like `float avgletter = ((float)count_letters / count_words) * 100;` or `float avgletter = 100.0 * count_letters / count_words;` (100.0 is a floating point value)

The size of an array variable on stack cannot be changed later. You need to give your array a size, like `int array[4];`. Alternatively, it could automatically determine the size from an initialiser, like `int array[] = {4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42};` or `char greeting[] = ""Hello!"";`.

@Jrua 
> I went back and re did this one because I thought my solution was messy but now I get wrong float averages for everything. If i have 80 letters, 21 words, and 3 sentences i somehow get an average letter of 4,0000000 and an average sentence value of .15000000
@Jrua  Thanks mate. I went back to check mine and realised int words variable was equal to zero instead of one. It's working well now.","",""

To give you a reference - here is my code (i highlighted the problematic area, i ran it through debugging in IDE and through printf 🙂 ).
What i`m trying to do is to make an array with ""n"" length first, then send it into other function along with the given text. This function takes a char from the text, and, if it is a letter - assigns it to a certain place of a certain string in an array, if space - goes to the next string in the array. 
it gives me a ""segmentation fault"" error with the very first char of the text. 
I have two assumptions - either at this moment array does not know its length so i assign char to nowhere (but i tried initializing and assigning it in different places, including right after #include blablabla), or i cannot assign strings in array char by char.

I did the math manually and the index is around 7.3.. which cant possibly round to 8. However, the Check gave the ""Grade 8"", mine got ""Grade 7"". 

Currently, I set float for letters, words, sentences, L, S. Int for index and round().

ok so notice how before the name of the function you define a type, in this case int?
this means this function is suppose to output some kind of int value
now, to return an int value, you need to return some kind of variable or some kind of calculated value, as such:

int letter_count(some paramemters)
{
**some cool code stuff happens here**
return **some kind of value**
}

but what you did is try to return the name of the function itself.
basically you just need to save the letter count in some separate variable and return that variable once you're done counting up letters","",""

Add this to the top of your code ```#include<math.h>```

His left arm was somewhat shorter than his right; when he stood or walked, the back of his hand was at right angles to his body, his thumb parallel to his thigh.""

That's 295 chars, 70 words, 3 sentences, at an average of 4.20 characters per word. (295 / 70)

@VirtualCat you are using all letters between 65 and 122 , which contains many non alphanumeric characters like symbols etc
also using text[count] > 65 skips the fist letter so you should modify you code accordingly

A few things I noticed in the code above.
In your program you're storing the user input as a string variable. So you would only need to pass a string into your function which is different from a char. 
Then break down what you need to do.
How can you find the length of this string? 
Using this length, perhaps how can you go through (loop through) each element of this string? 
isalpha() returns either 1 or 0 (True or False) for a char you pass into it. So on the right track, with when to do the counter, but it would happen within the loop.
Hope that sort of makes sense?","",""
