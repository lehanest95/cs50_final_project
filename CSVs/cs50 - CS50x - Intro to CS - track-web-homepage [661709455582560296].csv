But the fact that I couldn't figure it out is really discouraging. I've been programming in python and c# for more than 10 years but for some reason when it comes to html and css I just can't get my head around it.

Yes and no. If no content needs to change, figure out the minimum width of your current website so that it down't fall apart (basically shrink the width on your computer until it does fall apart and figure out the area of the viewport), then write in a media query in your css to redesign the content that fell apart for widths less than your specified amount. Paddings, margins, widths, heights, sizes etc. can also be defined in terms of percentages of viewport width and height (vw (viewport width), vh (viewport height)), so you can actually have your site shrink down on lower resolution PCs, and therefore, really only need one media query though it is acceptable and well known for people to use one for a PC, one for a laptop, one for a tablet, and one for a phone.

If content does need to change, you will have to use javascript to change the content as well.","","üëç (1)"
