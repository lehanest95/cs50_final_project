As its name might suggest, it’s related to make, the program you’ve probably been using compile most of your programs, if only because compiling programs with clang itself tends to require more keystrokes. In previous problems, we’ve not needed a Makefile, which is essentially a configuration file for make, since make can infer how to compile a program that’s composed of a single file (e.g., hello.c). But compiling both notes and synthesize requires multiple files, since both programs rely on wav.h and wav.c, plus two other files, helpers.h and helpers.c.

Simply executing

make notes
or

make synthesize
wouldn’t provide nearly enough information for make to be able to infer which files it needs. So this Makefile exists so that make knows how to compile these programs.```","",""

When writing the `fraction()` function, you will eventually need to convert a `char` which represents an integer to an actual `int`.
Like @curiouskiwi said, this can be done using subtraction:
`int x = '0' - '0';` will yeild 0.
`int x = '1' - '0';`will yeild 1.

Assuming note is 'Bb3', the first if which checks if index 2 is not 4 should be true, because index 2 is 3 (index 0: B, index 1: b, index 2: 3).

the next if checks to see if index 2 is larger than 4, which it's not because it's 3. So.. this should fall through to the 'else' right? Well whenever i run this it seems to think that index 2 is larger than 4..

Am I missing something? 

I also tried to convert index 2 into an indexed char. ascii value of 3 being 51, i did note[2] - 48, which would equal 3, just in case the if condition was using the decimal value of the char.","",""

In the context of frequency specifically, taking baby steps might mean:

Only implement support initially for A0 through A8, no other notes. Ensure that frequency returns the expected values for those notes, as by running notes or using debug50 or eprintf. Compare your function’s output against your own calculations on paper or on a calculator.","",""

anyways, one of the things you're comparing is an int and the other a char*, which doesn't work. if you want to compare a whole string, == doesn't work for that in C, you will need strcmp(). 
if you want to compare a single char, it will work, but than you have to set the types right. you need to consider that NOTES[i] can be one or multiple chars.

For is_rest, I checked if the string was equal to """", if yes, return true, otherwise return false.
For duration, I initialized an int value, accessing function[2], and established a counter. I ran a while loop as long as y is not equal to zero, and subtracted from y by 2.

My pseudo for frequency declares a int n, for number of semitones from A4. I'm thinking of using A4 as zero, and each semitone away is +/- 1, so Ab4/G#4 would be -1, and Bb4/A#4 would be 1. Is this the right way to think of this? Using the note string, I'd find the length (either 1 or 2), then have a number of if statements to check the note, the accidentals, and the number to determine the value of n.

Is this the best way to do this, or is there an improvement I can make to my pseudo before I start?","",""

sizeof() operator is used in different way according to the operand type.

1. When operand is a Data Type.
When sizeof() is used with the data types such as int, float, char… etc it simply return amount of memory is allocated to that data types.

On the flip side, in some cases it could be better to have them not know what it means to avoid less confusion, with the mindset of ""all they have to know is to put *m* or whatever into this function here.""

Guys, I don't understand what n is in this for-loop. I looked up on a different website that sizeof() returns the size when fed with an array. So n is equal to the size of the NOTES array divided by sizeof(string).

If there is a character that is not a number it stops so we are ""lucky"" in this case where we can do(for the duration) int first_part_of_fraction = atoi(string[0]); because straight after the first character there is this '/' that stops it. (i.e. 1/4).

But it wasn't for the '/' in between we would have to break the string down into single characters and turn them into ints one by one. But atoi only accepts strings (pointers that point to a character). So we would have to turn each character of the string into characters and then immediately input them to a string so we would have to do:

string s = ""1/4"";
char a = s[0];
string b = &a; // So we pass a's pointer to make the string
b[1] = '\0' //to ensure the string ends there
