"398940709593284608","emldn#4617","20-Mar-18 12:54 AM","Hey guys,

Sorry for being a noob but I'm still having difficulty understanding the algebra and variables behind ""for loops: repetition"". In my first attempt of mario.c, I ended up using if / else for each interger from 1 to 23. I know this isn't the best way to do it, so I redid the code using ""for loops: repetition"" with a walkthrough guide online. It works... but I still don't feel confident with this aspect of the code.

For example:
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
{
     for (int j = 0; j < n - 1 - i; jj+)
          {
           printf("" "")
           }
     for (int j = 0; j < i + 1; jj+)
           {
           printf(""#"")
           }
}

I know this code works and is getting the job done but I'm still finding it hard to understand what each component is doing? I'm not sure if I could replicate this on my own, without a walkthrough, but I want to master it and understand it properly. Is there a good website or YouTube video online that explains it really well?","",""

I'll say this as an advice, when you have a for loop and inside it another for loop, you can use it to your advantage, now that you have another variable like i  so you can use it for your advantage and play with things in your program, again I'd say first focus on the hashes loop.","",""

"531973987438166016","muffinbreakfast#5216","09-Jan-19 01:45 AM","i'll try. pretend user inputs a height of 10. n = 10. in the draw pyramid section, the for loop will execute all the code underneath while i < n (therefore, once i increments above 10, then it will stop looping). let's call this Loop1. there is another for loop nested within it. let's call this Loop2. Loop2 initialises a new variable j and the loop will run while j is less than n (10) + 1, so 11. that loop will execute the conditional within it, which is an if/else conditional. the if condition states that if the values of i + j are greater than or equal to n (10) - 1, then print a hash. else print a space. Loop1 executes and checks if Loop2 boolean condition is true (j <n+1? Yes because j is initialised to 0). Loop 2 executes, j increments to 1, we now face the if/else conditional. i at this point is 0, j is 1 and so i + j = 1. this is not >= n (10)-1, and so the else executes and prints a space. in fact, 9 spaces should be printed until j = 9 (because i = 0 at this point, and the addition of both = 9 which is n (10) - 1). once j + i equals 9, the hash will be printed. Loop2, however, has not finished because once the hash is printed, j only equals 10 and that's still less than n(10) + 1. Loop2 executes 1 more time and triggers the if conditional printing 1 more hash. This is another bug because for the first iteration, it should have only printed 9 spaces and 1 hash, but now it has printed 9 spaces and 2 hashes. while the height is 10, your rows have 1 additional hash than they should (e.g. your bottom row should have the same number of hashes as your height). for reference, you are printing this:","",""

- Watch the lecture and pay close and thorough attention to everything in it. Watch the shorts videos if you need to understand loops, conditionals etc more or to get a better understanding conceptually
 - Google and learn what pseudocode is
- Write pseudocode
- Translate pseudocode into C code
- Write some code then test it. Then write a little more code and test it. Then write some more code and test it and so on. If you try and keep writing a bunch of code and then test your code at the end without having tested it along the way and it doesn't work, then it will just get way more harder and more frustrating then it needs to be than if you wrote some and test it along the way. This helps out a lot with finding and fixing bugs in your code.

If you still don't understand some things then take one of those things and break it down and figure out what you're not understanding about it and then Google the misunderstanding part and/or read the documentation on it.","","üá∫ (2),üá∏ (2),üá™ (2),üáß (2),üáÆ (2),üá≥ (2),üá¨ (2),‚ùó (2),üëå (1)"

From curiouskiwi#1671 (pinned):
""You need to figure out the pattern.  If you have a pyramid with height of 5, it looks like this:   (where I've put s for space):
```ssss##
sss###
ss####
s#####
######```

so if you look at the pattern : 
```4 spaces 2 hashes
3 spaces 3 hashes
2 spaces 4 hashes
1 space  5 hashes
0 spaces 6 hashes```

can you see what happens to the number of spaces as you print each row?  and the number of hashes as you print each row?  and what the number starts at, based on the height variable?""","",""

I know next to nothing about programming but I'm determined to learn and you have to remember that C really is quite low level language and it takes a lot of trial and error to learn.   There's clues in the lecture to be looking at a few of the examples they give.  Specifically 'positive.c' and the 'cough' files. 

 I've managed to finally get mario-less to 100% after 6 attempts at submitting to check50 and two days of breaking it and trying different things.  I did move on to the next assignment since getting 70% and let me tell you it doesn't really get any easier!  Best to stick with this one until you've figured it out.","","‚ù§ (1)"

. 
the for loops we're using here
1.) check to see if the condition is true (if it's false, it skips to the next line after the loop)
2.) runs the code inside the loop
3.) increments its counter variable by the amount you specify
4.) returns to step 1
. 
so when you have a for loop nested inside another for loop, what's happening is that 
the outer loop runs once;
hits the inner loop, which runs over and over until it hits false;
the outer loop runs once;
hits the inner loop, etc.
. 
. 
here's a pseudocode example:
. 
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
‚û°Ô∏èprintf(""i=%i "", i);
‚û°Ô∏èfor (int w = 0; w < 3; w++) 
‚û°Ô∏è{
‚û°Ô∏è‚û°Ô∏èprintf(""w=%i "", w);
‚û°Ô∏è} 
‚û°Ô∏èprintf(""\n"");

and the output:

`for` loops always come in the form of
```c
for (init; condition; step) // two semicola

where `init` is performed before everything else, and might include variable declarations (limited to one type, but might be multiple variables).
`condition` is an expression that is evaluated before entering the loop body, and if it evaluates to `false`/`0`/`'\0'`/`NULL`, loop will end.
`step` is executed after the `body`, and before re-evaluating `condition`.
`body` is a single statement or a code block (enclosed in curly braces).","",""

Both loops are pretty simple, repeating something 10 times, and the loop variables are not used for anything complicated.
Even in this case, though, I would rather use names like `row` and `column` (or something like that) instead of `y` and `x`, as those better describe what the variables represent.","",""

    {
       n = get_int(""%s"", input);

since we are looking for a number between 0 and 9, why does this need to be an `OR (||)` rather than an `AND (&&)`? It seems to me that the variable `n` would need to be between 0 AND 9 for the while loop to be true, rather than between 0 OR 9?

Additionally, when this code is run and a 1 or 8 is entered by the user, it returns that value. I'm not understanding why the operators can simply be `< and >` rather than `<= and >=`||","",""

zero is less than one (0<1 is TRUE)

but zero is not greater than 8  (0>8 is FALSE)

So here's what I have so far. As far as the spaces goes it makes sense in my head... at a height of 8 for example the number of spaces would be 7 yeah? I'm not sure about my condition though... And for the hashes since there will always be at least 2 I have that (although I'm not sure if that is accurate and of course you can write things many different ways) the condition I'm unsure about as well. Do I need to print the left and the right separately? I think that would make more sense and was my original intention ü§î anyway sorry I'm all over the place üòÖ  I know there are obvious problems but I'm stumped on how to go about fixing them.","",""

if your outer loop is
for (int i = 0;...;...){

}
then i is changing by 1 in each successive row.  You can use this changing value of i to change how many times the inner loop will run.  The condition in the inner loop will include the i variable.  The i variable will be = 0 in the first row.  In the first row you need 1 hash, and then one more hash on each row.  so if you also initialise an inner variable j to 0, then you need a condition so that when i = 0, the inner loop for hashes will run once, and when i = 1, twice etc.
The number of times to print a space isn't related to just the value of i.  But you know what the total number of ""spaces + hashes"" will be on each line.","","üôè (1)"

Let's look at the logic of your code, in pseudocode, for your pyramid print.  (This is actually when pseudo code can be useful, as there are mistakes in how you've constructed your loops.)

```{for every row
  [for every hash I want
    (for every fullstop I want
      print a fullstop)
   print a hash]
  move to a new line```

Looking at each thing that will actually print, and it's loop logic:
moving to a new line:
for every row, move to a new line (that looks great)
for hashes:
for every row, for every hash I want, print a has (awesome)
for fullstops:
for every row, for every hash I want, for every fullstop I want, print a fullstop (something's not right there)

So where does the fullstop loop go?  We can we put it so that the loop logic matches what we actually want?","","üëç (1)"

The outer loop will have some variable that adjusts how the loops inside it work.  In this case, int x = 0; x < n ; x++ means on the first loop, x=0, and each outer line it will increase by one.  So for each outer loop x=

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

As you have done we use that changing value of x to adjust how many of each symbol is printed:

x=  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
'.=  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0

I will give you a direct hint at the end, but since you need to add the spaces still, if we don't go over the actual problem then you'll be back to square one when doing the spaces.  Your outer loop is well formed.  i starts at 0, increases by 1 each line, loops while i is less than the height.  That means it with loop (height) times.  Excellent.

Now how is i being used in the inner loop?

j is set to i, and then j increases until n.  n is always less than i, so each line will always print something, which is a good sign.  But how many times will each line loop printing #?

On the first line, i = 0, so j increases from 0 up towards the height, so on the first line, (height) #'s will be printed.
On the second line, i=1, so j increases from 1 up towards height.  The second line will print (height - 1) times.
etc., reducing the number printed by 1 each line.

This is not what we want.  We want the start and end points of the inner loop to be 1, 2, 3, 4... units apart.  And we know that i varies as 0, 1, 2, 3...  We have to choose the start and end j values to print this many.

Hint:  ||(n - i) is decreasing each line, and you can see that i is the start point for the inner loop and n is the end point.  (i - 0) is increasing each line||","",""

then print characters one by one, and then go to the next line.

The outer loop is a way for collecting together smaller processes in the inner loop(s).  So the outer loop is for the line, and the inner loop(s) are for individual characters
In standard cartesian coordinates that would be inner = x, outer=y, but that's more of a description of what type of characters we are printing inside the loops.

Yeah you've got the right idea about ""printing one less"".  Key to that, i is increasing by 1 with each row.  Then we need to create an inner loop that changes how many times it loops through.  This is done by altering the loop conditions.  for (int j = ?; ?someLoopCondition?;  j++?--?)  We have a lot of options there to make it loop a certain number of times, but we can also use the i from the outer loop, or the height variable that we have received as input from the user.  This is often key to constructing nested loops, using information from the outer loops to change what you are doing inside them.","",""

If we needed four # to be printed, we could use a loop where
int j = 0; j < 4; j++
int j = 1; j <= 4; j ++
int j = 4; j >= 0; j--
int j = 21; j > 17; j--

"324522780252962816","Sinergy#7605","27-Mar-20 03:50 AM","but you get more complex loops the more the parameters start to affect what you do inside the loops.  Like you might have something like this, which is arguably the most complex:
```for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
  for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++)
  {
    printf(""%i%i\n"", i, j);
  }
}```
which will start i at zero, and increase it by one each loop.  and each time it does that, the j value will start at zero and go up to 9.  and then it will print those two values right next to each other.  So this will start at 00, then 01, 02...09,10, 11.  It will print the numbers from 00 to 99.  You can see that the actual values of the parameters are critical to this, because they are used in the print operation in the centre.  So we need to give consideration to how we choose loop conditions, and how they change how things would run inside them.","","üëç (1)"

I am stuck in understanding why my code works. It just worked by pure trial and error. Please walk me through this loop step by step, row by row and explain in a half pyramid how would you label/visualize rows and columns. A diagram you could draw would really help too.

```for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)

I tried asking some people on Slack but am even more confused by the answer since won't according to the following explanation won't a flipped version of the required half-pyramid be the result. The answer was as follows:

you are saying that if the height is 4, then you want 3 spaces.

so your loop goes `j is 3, print a space, j is 2, print a space, j is 1, print a space, j is 0 (not > 0) so stop. and you‚Äôve now printed 3 spaces on your top row (when i is 0)

then your second loop says, j is 0 and that‚Äôs equal i (0), so print a hash

then it stops since next time j is 1 and that‚Äôs not <= 0

so now you‚Äôve printed one hash

so your top row is now

 ```#```
then i is incremented to 1.","",""

```
is that the first sub-loop  will in a sense number the columns from 4 to 1 since 0 is not > i (which in this case is row 0 so i is 0). So if you were to visually number the columns it would be 4, 3, 2, 1 so thus there will be four spaces and from left to right. This will repeat for all the following rows. For second sub-loop the first column from left can be visualized as numbered 0 and then it will continue as 0 ... till j< = i which in this case since i or row is 0 will be till j<=1 which is till 0 since j <= i and now j < = 0 (in case of top row) and so last j (column) can be 0 since i (row) is 0 in this case as indicated by the MAIN Loop for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) so this will be from 0 to 0 so it is iterated once and this will give you one hash","",""

And it still works. My original question for my first code was: 
I have understood that the first j and second j in my code are not the same and count differently and that a variable no longer exists after a loop is over. For instance even for i , in this case it counts from top row to bottom as 0 and so on because of the i++ and for instance in another question int i = n; i>=0; i-- it would count as n, n-1, n-2 and so on till 0. Say I have n=5 and then since n - 1 is equal to 4 j (columns) will go as 4, 3, 2, 1 and not 0 since j>i (i is 0 in this case of top row) . Now for 4, 3, 2, 1 as values of J a blankspace will be printed. Now thinking about second subloop in first code j wills tart as 0 and then has to increase or stay same because of j++ so will stay same as j<=0 and this satisfies it as 0 = 0  so 1 hash will be printed. Now I asked @Atish how does the computer know whether to print the 4 space and 1 hash starting from left side of the screen or right side of screen. They said it follows the order of code and loops and I changed it. Why does it still work? I am so confused.","",""

> So in this code I will explain the first top row where i=0. let us say n is equal to 5 since we want height as 5. Now in my first inner (baby loop) which I have commented atop as blank spaces will manifest itself in such a way that j (columns) will start from n-1, which in this case is 4 and will continue till 1 since 0 is not satisfying the condition of j>i (i being 0 in this case). Now we have the columns being able to be visualized as 4,3,2,1 (decreasing in number because of the j--) so 4 times and thus the blankspace will be print 4 times from left to right. Now we talking about second inner (baby loop). Now in second baby (inner loop) commented on as hashes j will start as 0 (columns) and will continue to stay same or increase (because of j++) till j<=i (this condition is met). So since i is 0 (top row) j will be left at 0 since 1 can not meet 1 < = 0 . So now hash will be printed once in front of the spaces and then after hash because of the \n that is in second line of second baby loop hashes it will hit ENTER.

This is because my blankspaces baby (inner) loop precedes (is executed before)  the hashes baby (inner) loop. Now my big loop 
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
 has three parts: 2 of which we covered the two baby (inner) loops and then the last line which is outside the 2 loops 
printf(""\n"");
 so when the big loop 
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
 goes through what is inside its big brackets (what it contains) for each row ( or i0, i1, i2 and so on) it will first execute baby loop 1 and baby loop 2 and then will go to next line/ hit ENTER.

@jameswu In line 12, inside the for loop, you declare i = 0, but iterate until i is less than OR EQUAL TO n (i <= n). This way, instead of printing n lines, the program prints n + 1 lines. You can fix that by either declaring i = 1 or iterating until i is less than n (i < n).","",""

@Beso I'm glad you could figure out what was wrong! If you want some suggestions:
1) The indentation / formatting is a bit janky, `style50` could help you with that.
2) The `do / while` loop in lines 13 through 18 could be simplified into just a `while` loop or a `for` loop.
3) Since `brick` prints out a whole row, and the newline character is part of a row, you could move `printf(""\n"")` inside the function. It's just an opiniaon, but I think it would look neater that way.","",""

@Platypus316 okay. (lets forget for the time being, the pyramid will be left aligned, but you need right aligned for the set.) but why do you think it stops at two, even when your input is say 8? so if you look at your code, which line do you think is executing this?","",""

it's not entirely different

@TGPG You declared the variable num inside the do block which makes it available only inside that so if you call it from outside that scope it won't be available, you could instead declare it above the do loop which makes it in the main function's scope and it will be available to everything inside that function","","üëç (3),‚ù§Ô∏è (1)"

If it is still true, it loops again, else it breaks.  So id you say do whilst 'a <5' for example, then set a 0, and increment a at the end of each loop, you will get 5 loops.  The first one where a=0, second as a=1 (Because you incremented at the end of the do loop), third as a=2, fourth as a=3, fifth as a=4, and at the end of that loop when a is incremented it makes a 5, so then when it checks the condition it is now not <5, so it breaks and moves on to the next section of code if there is some.","",""

@Montee Your printf statement doesn't make sense.  When you use a placeholder, then it expects the name of the integer to be used after the comma, not the character to print.

Get comfortable with the thougt of an overarching loop and several loops / operations within it. Loops within another loop always play through their entire program - or as far as they can go within the overarching loop's current cycle. A change by cycle can be done by interconnecting the variables of loops and using ""+1"" operations. Also pay attention to the succession of loops and operations within an overarching loop - or just switch these around randomly at first to see what it does.","",""

```int blocks```
you are declaring a new variable called blocks which holds an integer value. as with all variables, when you declare a variable inside a code block (between two curly braces, i.e. ""{...}""), you can only use that variable within that code block. once the program has finished running everything in the block that variable basically goes away

what you were doing was creating a new integer inside the while loop to store the value entered by the user. once the while loop had finished executing (the user entered a number between 1 and 8), that variable got destroyed because it was only created within the while.

normally you wouldn't be able to create another variable with the same name, but because the blocks variable was only created inside the while loop, you were allowed to create another variable called blocks outside the while loop. but that was a completely new variable called blocks. the first was was destroyed so you had lost the value that was storing the number entered by the user","",""
