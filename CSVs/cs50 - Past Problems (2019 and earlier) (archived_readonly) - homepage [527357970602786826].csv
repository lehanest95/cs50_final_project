I think also that bootstrap makes the code bad to read. One reason is that the documentation does not use many html 5 tags and  prefererd to use divs for everything. With modern html and css capabilities this framework is not needed.","",""

I was trying to declare a new array then reference it later in a loop using the push method however when I declared the new array using let or var It wouldn't work however when I leave nothing before it it would. Does anyone have any Idea why? is it to do with scope. Everything is declared within the same function.

For example this would not work
var numArray = new Array();
let numArray = new Array();

This would
numArray = newArray();","",""

`var` is function scope, similar to Python
`let` is block scope, like in C
So is the declaration and the loop happening in the same function?","",""
