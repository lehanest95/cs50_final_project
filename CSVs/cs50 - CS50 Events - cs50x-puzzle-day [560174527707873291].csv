I started cs50x just after cs50x puzzle day 2019. I want to do the puzzles, but I also want a way to check whether my answer is correct without finding out the correct answer.
Well, I just finished Week 2 of the program and am loving it so much that I went and 'wasted' 4 hours writing a (certainly poorly designed :D) program that does what I described - checks whether the answer you input matches the solution for any question. 

Check it out and see what you think. You have to run it in cs50 sandbox (just copy paste) because I'm using strings, which are defined in cs50.h... and I'd rather move on with the course than try to work out a better way to do it which i'll probably learn in coming weeks.
Also the solutions are pretty much at the top of the code so spoilers - just make your terminal full size (i dunno how to move them without just hitting enter haha) XD
Again, I've been coding for like a week (and i copy-pasted a lot donthurtme) so feel free to make it better or tell me what I could've improved","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/560174527707873291/569373269027979307/puzzledaysolutions.c",""

You can see the results from all the teams here.  The puzzles were in no particular order as far as difficulty goes, but there were hints that next year they will increase in difficulty through the test.

@pi_master we find that if you get more than 4 or 5, it starts to mean that not everyone is able to fully participate.  Everyone on the team should be working together to solve *every* problem... the idea is **not** to have a really big team and split the problems up so that everyone only works on 1 or 2.   That's what we see start to happen when teams get beyond a handful of members.","",""

Then, out of these list of countries, I tried to find which were the northernmost, southernmost and closest to sea level.

Northernmost: Russia - Moscow (1st letter)
Southernmost: Mauritius - Port Louis (2nd letter)
Closest to Sea Level: Estonia - Talinn (3rd letter)

Therefore, it was either RAT, or MOL.

However, as the title was symbolism, I looked at the bold boxes, which looks like a rat. Thus, I concluded the answer was rat.

I would like to know whether this will also be counted as correct or not.","",""
