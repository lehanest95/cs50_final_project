did you ever consider bridging this room to the matrix.org network. with that bridge you could acess many other ecossystems like slack/irc/gitter/xmpp etc. It is a very user-friendly easy to setup bridge that was created by one of the matrix.org employees. here is link for this specific bridge https://t2bot.io/discord/ or if you want to learn more about matrix.org here theyre website https://www.matrix.org/. It is a super cool project, trying to do the same thing as xmpp wanted to but learning with their mistakes and fixing their problems.(edited)

I'm a begginer in all of this, I'm on the course of understanding technology and I have a question, I know every byte is 8 bits but how does the computer knows the difference between two information units, for example if I want to write 1 and then 2 in binary I would write 001 and 010 but how the computer knows if its 001 and then 010 or just 001010 which gives a totaly different value?

@Or ashkenazi it know this becasue there is a brake between the 2 they are not connected together so for example you would have 0001 0010 0101 and that would be 1 2 5","",""
