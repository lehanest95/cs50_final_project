Having a char pointer would be defining a box that can only hold a piece of paper that tells you where to look for that characters.

Could you guys help me?
I have just finished my code for crack, the algorithm managed to decrypt all passwords, except stelios' and bjbrown's.
For both passwords, the IDE just keeps thinking forever (it's been 30 minutes already hahahaha), probably because they are longer and have mixed Uppercase and Lowercase letters, as I dealt first with all Uppercase, all Lowercase, and then mixed.
I think the algorithm is right, since it cracked the other ones.","",""

Stack exchange (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8732325/how-to-declare-strings-in-c) says that you need to declare the size after adding the ""\0"" at the end, e.g. if I were to declare the string ""apple"" I would use ```c
char str[6] = ""apple"";
```
However, when i am working with crack, I found out that when I follow this rule and declare the string length as 1 more than the number of letters, the last element is some undefined character. Instead, I tried just declaring the string size as the number of letters and it worked, like this:```c
char letters[52];   // Initializaes string with all 52 upper and lower case letters
    for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++)
    {
        letters[i] = 65 + i;
        letters[i + 26] = 97 + i;

As of now I've managed to write boolean function which returns true if the generated password is correct or not. The problem though is the generating part. I can't seem to wrap my head around generating every permutation of a given string, iterating over the alphabet.
Bellow is just some test code to help me understand how to get all the combinations of 'aaaaa' iterating over the alphabet. I'm just focusing on lower case as of now, the uppercase part will be another problem I think I'll manage to solve. Also, I don't check the password in the code bellow, I just want see if I can get all the permutations first. My gut tells me I might need another for-loop. What do you guys think?

```c
    char password[] = ""aaaaa"";
    printf(""%s\n"", password);

Is there a way to write a string (slash character array) without storing it into a variable?
I'm currently doing 
    char salt[3] = {argv[1][0], argv[1][1]};
and then
    crypt(key, salt);
But I'm wondering if I could write something like this instead
    crypt(key, {argv[1][0], argv[1][1]});
to bypass writing the ""salt ="" part.","",""

I don't know if this is considered a spoiler, but ""the trick"" for me was realizing that the salt is saved with the password. So the computer knows what hash was used when you first created your password. If your password is ""hunter2"" it would be hashed with a random salt like ""9a"". The hash is created with ""9ahunter2"". So another user with this awesome password would get another random salt like ""zG"", so the hash is created with ""zGhunter2"". If you just look at the password file, you would not know that this user has the same password as you. Also if a hacker has access to the password file she cannot just search for all standard password pre-hashed, as it is always hashed with a random salt. That makes it harder for the hacker, or at least it takes longer. 

If you log in a second time with your hunter2 password, a new hash is created and checked with the saved hash. It has to be the same to let you through. So the same salt has to be used. This is why the original salt is saved together with the password. So every login attempt can be hashed with the same salt that was originally created.","",""

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    {
        for (int n = 0; n < 10; n++)

I see that for each iteration of the for loop it also goes through all of the iterations of the second for loop. Meaning, for every value that int i could be it goes through every value that int n could be. So, it gives me every possible combination that a two digit each digit ranging from 0-9 combination there could be. Is the logic and explanation of what is happening here correct?

looks right, as you would want to keep looping if you hit the maximum length but haven't found the password yet, you just don't want to increase recursion depth any more. Maybe something like
```c
    if (strcmp(tStr, hash) == 0)
    {
        return true;
    }
    else if (pos < len)
```
Also, make sure to add the null terminator (and have space for it!), like
```c
            tStr[pos] = i;
            tStr[pos + 1] = '\0';
```
I'd add another string parameter where you would pass the alphabet to use.","",""

I used a separate array for the indices (that's where I would increment), a hard-coded string as an alphabet, and an array for the actual password (initialised to all zeroes, and changed whenever I update an index).

Once you get this right then you understand the basic concept and all you need to do is replicate this model until you have 4 characters in a row.

tl;dr: I know it's a complicated explanation, so don't bother with it unless you're interested :D

Actually, I remembered what was the problem exactly.
I was able to exit the recursive func itself, but it was wrapped inside a for loop in an outer function, and I needed to break out of this outer loop on the exit condition of the recursive func.

If the recursive func exits successfully, the loop continues invoking that function unless there's a global variable check (that's being set with the successful exit). And I can't simply return a success code and check if it's true to break out of the outer loop.

I'll play around more with it later, but I can't figure out how to refactor it.
For now, I'm just happy it's finally works üòÑ","",""

Just finished the crack assignment from Problem Set 2.
However I feel like my code could be better, seeing as it is quite repetitive with regards to iterating over different password lengths. I keep thinking that perhaps there's a way to this with a custom function?
Also I vaguely remember David saying something about a rule of thumb that the maximum amount of nested for loops should rarely exceed 3. I have 5 nested for loops in the section of my program where it checks for a match for a 5 letter password.

@AFRS You should double check with someone more knowledgable just in case, but I believe it's essentially a function that takes a string and a ""salt"" as arguments and returns a ""hash"" by performing some sort of math equation on the inputs. 

It's a one way computation though, and so you can't simply run a calculation on the hash to turn it back into the original string","",""

I've been playing with it in the IDE to work up crack.c - to follow my code I've put some printf()s in and am using ""50"" as the salt and ""B"" as the key. If I run crypt using these parameters in the scope of main(), I return a hash 50awdcPOdlHdE and I've saved that to a char *hashTwo. Now, if I run crypt using the same 50 / B parameters (stored in new variables) within a for loop, the crypt hash is instead 50Sx5GEnnqonc. Following debug50 I can see the value at hashTwo has changed from 50awd... to 50Sx5... I assume this is because crypt() stores the hash in a memory location and the output variable pointer simply points to that char *, so any other pointers would see their value change.

"393854278764068875","curiouskiwi#1671","19-Oct-19 02:34 AM","well, here goes.   When the compiler compiles, it pushes the different variables onto the stack memory.  In the case of your program, before it makes the function call to crypt, it has to put the parameters onto the stack.  So it puts the address of the string literal ""50"" (ie, your salt) onto the stack and it puts 'B' (your xTwo) onto the stack.  In memory, those are stored consecutively.  So crypt runs and it uses for the password 'B' + the actual address of ""50"" 

When you call then declare saltThree to ""50"", because it's the same string literal, the compiler treats it as the same as saltTwo so it only has the same address.   It puts that address onto the stack and  then puts xThree 'B' onto the stack.  Now crypt is called again.

Because the unterminated 'B' is followed in memory by that same salt address, you get the same garbage string.

In your for loop, that's in a different spot in memory, so you don't.","",""

But, the compiler determines that there are two identical string literals (saltTwo and saltThree) and assigns them the same memory address, I assume for efficiency? If I were to later change saltTwo or saltThree (or any two identical string literals), then, I should be aware of the fact that changing one will change both, so should do so via strcpy().

"322973582432927757","kadavraverkisto#7943","06-Dec-19 12:11 AM","@risen_hate / soangrypanda I saw it like this: when a string is ""increased"", there is a ""wave"" of increment moving from one end. Often it stops immediately, at the ending character, because it was not the last in the alphabet. Sometimes all the alternatives for the ending character are already used and the wave moves to the next (second to last) character in a row, while the ending character is reset. But then this second character gets the same treatment as the ending character on the previous step: it is either replaced with the next in the alphabet or reset to a with the wave moving on.
So instead of as many nesting cycles as the characters in the string, there can be two cycles, the outer cycle implementing the brute force search itself and the inner cycle implementing this wave replacing one character in the string and deciding if it will go to the next character or stop here.","",""
