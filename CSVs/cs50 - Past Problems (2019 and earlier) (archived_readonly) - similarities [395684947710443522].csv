"403626422016671744","jason#9686","06-Feb-18 12:49 AM","just found a little gotcha: It is very important that your [0][0] tuple has an operation of *None*! check50 passes with other values there, but when using flask run , application.py will fail with an index out of bounds error :  application.py contains a loop where that None in the [0][0] position is the end condition.  

In the walkthrough (essential watching) there is what I thought was a throwaway comment with lots of hand waving at  11:00 in https://youtu.be/YTO92oVoYwA?list=PLhQjrBD2T381-bOArPXzvlXpovpdBhrZ3&t=667 "" for matrix[0][0] there was no operation that needed to be done there, so just store None for the Operation in that case""  perhaps Brian could have said, ""store None for the operation at [0][0]  otherwise the code we've written to display operations will fail at run time...""  

Can we add a check50 test for this?","",""

At the moment I understand what I have to do, and how the dynamic programming approach works with edit distance. For example something that I'm trying to deal with is the tuples.  I'm trying to get the minimum cost for every cell in the matrix out of the 3 candidates (up, left and up-left), plus the enum with the last operation. I'm totally new to Python so how do you get both things from each tuple in the matrix?
I was trying something like this 
```Python
cost = min (
                 matrix[row_index - 1][column_index - 1][0] + delta_distance_between_chars(a[-1], b[-1]),
                 matrix[row_index][column_index - 1][0] + 1,
                 matrix[row_index - 1][column_index][0] + 1

You have to follow those rules so that the logic of finding the optimal solution via this table works.  Substitution is always diagonal, but it has two options; one is just coping what you had, and two substituting the character.","","👍 (2)"

2. how do i let the system know that both i and j in the slicing  function s[i:j] are variables which represent numbers?
