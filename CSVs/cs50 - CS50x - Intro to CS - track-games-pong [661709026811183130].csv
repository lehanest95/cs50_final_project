I have the paddle following the ball's y position. I'm also calculating the distance between the ball's y position and the paddle's y position to get the distance. This is to fix the jitteriness caused by the paddle_speed if the distance between the y positions is less than 200.  But now, for some reason, that logic is running, and it slows down the paddle from the very top to the very bottom, and I'm not sure why. üò¶ If someone could please help, I'd appreciate it.

@Resilienza  see first when you have downloaded love2d, and text editor (you can use notepad as i think but you can download if you want because it helps you find errors in many ways though never directly)

now you have to start  doing the code. you can copy from the source code which is given. please note that i haven't done the CS50X so i am telling you from what i did in the CS50G which i think is the same about games. you said you are just starting so it will only be 1 file in pong-0 which is main.lua. you have to make a zip file containing the main file and change the file extension of the zip file to .love then just open it and you have your game starting","",""
