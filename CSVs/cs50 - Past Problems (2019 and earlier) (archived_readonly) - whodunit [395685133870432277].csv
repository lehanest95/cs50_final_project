Go ahead and compile copy.c into a program called copy using make. (Remember how?) Then execute a command like the below.

./copy smiley.bmp copy.bmp
If you then execute ls (with the appropriate switch), you should see that smiley.bmp and copy.bmp are indeed the same size. Let’s double-check that they’re actually the same! Execute the below.

I understand that ASCII is only concerned with single characters, but was confused because 'bfType' is 2 bytes long, and can thus store 2 characters. If the bytes are going to be returned swapped in hexadecimal, I thought, why aren't they being returned swapped as chars? The answer (I think) is that a character is only one byte long, so if I ask for a character back, they can only be returned one at a time, at which point I will get the most significant byte first.","",""

In those BMP files, everything but the file header is divisible by 4 bytes (and for the usual applications, the file header is stripped after reading the image into RAM because it describes the file, not the image).
`fread` will (attempt to) read a number of bytes equal to the product of the two numbers. First number is a kind of ""block"" size you can choose (whatever makes sense in your context), second is the number of blocks to read, and it will return the successfully read blocks. That's the only point where it really matters how you pic the two factors, for this return value.

When approaching `whodunit` itself, you are not meant to delete `fread`, just manipulate the components of `triple` before you `fwrite` it. Therefore, I'd turn `fread` into a comment for that purple stage, or leave it and ignore the read values, replacing them with my own (purple ones).
`fread` would read to the memory address `&triple`, as many bytes as it reads (the product of the two numbers). It does not have any idea of the size of `triple`, so be careful how many bytes you ask it to read.
`fwrite` would write from that memory address, as many bytes as you tell it to. Same as `fread`, just from memory to file.","",""

But the number of bytes needed to code a row does not necessarily fit this condition. Each pixel takes three bytes. So if the width of the picture is not divisible by 4 itself (for example 10 pixels, which gives 30 bytes of the rgb data), the program should take into account that there will be several empty bytes (in this case, for example, two empty bytes, because 30+2=32 and 32=4*8) in the end of each row when it is saved on the disk.","",""

The original width in bytes is sort of presented as 4n+p, where n is any non-negative integer and p is a non-negative integer smaller than 4. The first module operator strips it of 4n and leaves only p. The subtraction calculates 4-p: that's how many bytes you need to get to the next quadruplet's end. But then one more module operator is needed, because the original width _can_ be divisible by 4, and then p=0 and 4-p=4, and we don't want extra four bytes in the end of the scanline when it is already okay. So the % is applied again, so that when 4-p=4, it is made into 0 (and when it is smaller than 4, it is left as is).","",""

"322973582432927757","kadavraverkisto#7943","29-Dec-19 10:28 AM","@LORIS Well, I'd say the details of the bitmap format are important less as something to learn for long use and more as a example of things that need to be learned for a particular task. There are lots of file formats, but they have a lot in common. Also I believe the basic ways to read and write files didn't change much since the era of C.
Of course, there can often be libraries of higher level, so that the programmer, who uses them, needs to type just one or two words to load an image from a file, or write it into a file, or select a particular pixel etc, or even modify the whole image in a certain way - instead of writing own functions like here. But there can be rare formats, for which there are no accessible libraries of this sort, or there can be a need to invent a new file format for a particular problem and work with it at this very level.
And speaking about the principles of pixel rows and rgb triples, they are more universal than bitmap itself, it's probably necessary to know them to understand something in image processing.
