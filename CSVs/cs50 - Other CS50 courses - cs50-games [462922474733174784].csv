So if the ball was at the same y as the paddle, I set dy to 0.  I proportionally increased dy until the ball was at the top or bottom of the paddle, where I set it to PADDLE_SPEED.    If the ball was outside the paddle, then I just set it to PADDLE_SPEED (appropriate sign, of course).  If you wanted to make it seem more like a real person was pushing buttons, allowing dy to be only +-PADDLE_SPEED (or 0), then  you could try using some hysteresis.  E.g., if the paddle was going up or stationary, then you wouldn't make it go down until the ball was further down the paddle (near the bottom instead of the center).   You could even estimate where the ball would hit the paddle if properly placed and move it full speed to precisely that location, ignoring the current y location.","",""

I did get error regarding love.window.getPixelScale()
function that is not supported any more.
So for me examples are not working on love 11.1
pong-0 is working fine 
With pong-1 i get:

Error

push.lua:101: attempt to call field 'getPixelScale' (a nil value)

So i replaced 'getPixelScale' with 'getDPIScale'
because
https://love2d.org/wiki/love.window.getPixelScale
wit pong-2 i get only white screen don't know why...
So I found love archive and downloaded 10.0 considering both course date and getPixelScale function removal in newer versions

If anyone wants recommendations for additional game dev courses, let me know. I have taken a few so far and found some other ones that are quite helpful. 

I anyone wants a better explanation of what Delta Time is, let me know as well. Also, check out the YouTube series Handmade Hero. That series is, by far, the best tutorial on game development out there - and it's free. The guy builds an entire game from scratch. Including the engine itself! The concepts you learn just from the first 2 videos will propel your game development knowledge ahead by years. 

The concepts are useful in ALL programming actually, not just game development. He teaches you with great ease how to understand the fundamental workings and concepts of binary, machine language, and how compilers work, and gives you a fundamental understanding of what a programming language is and how it operates and is created. He is also an AMAZING teacher and is concise, precise, explains things clearly and thoroughly, and is never boring.","",""

"333842064150102026","LicensedToThrill#1059","29-Jul-18 12:02 PM","So DeltaTime is like this -- Imagine you have to walk 100 meters in 1 second. Well, we know that the game engine iterates over the main loop (in this case, update()) over and over X number of times per second. This is our framerate, in frames per second. Each iteration is 1 frame. I know you probably know this, but I just wanted to write the whole thought. 

So now to travel 100 meters in that single second, the update( ) loop needs to divide the 100 evenly among the X fps. In most cases, this is 60 in video games. (24 for film 30 for youtube). But what happens if someone's PC can only run at 30? Or an Xbox hooked to an older TV runs at 30? Well 100 / 60 = 1.66~. But if the framerate suddenly goes down to 30... well now you have 1.66~ x 30, which means the character only traveled 30 meters. Or, if the framerate increases past 60, to say, 120, then now the character travels 100 meters in 0.5 seconds. 

So deltatime just measures the exact time of each frame down to a fraction of a second and multiplies it by the 1.66 (speed as distance per second, or in our class examples, just a number like 20 or 67 or 12) so that the speed is adjusted proportionally to however fast or slow the game is running, which forces the character to accurately run 100 meters in exactly 1 second (or very, very close). 

And delta time is easily measured in a game engine by assigning the current system time at the top of the loop, and then again at the bottom of the loop, and then subtracting the two and returning the difference, or delta. That's also a neat trick for script writers to determine how long it takes their code to run. I use this in Python to determine how long it takes my port scanner to scan all 25565 ports. (3 ish seconds, by the way -- not bad!)","",""

"333842064150102026","LicensedToThrill#1059","29-Jul-18 12:12 PM","So that's why people who say ""humans can't see over 30 FPS, so 60FPS doesn't matter in games"" are both correct (about human vision) but entirely wrong (about game speed). Because the actual scripts and simulations of the game and AI and physics and everything is determined by FPS. 

People think of FPS as meaning visual frames, but it actually refers to how fast or slow the game runs all of it's math and calculations as well. So it's very important in physics heavy games or games with lots of mods. Or in games like Minecraft that have electrical and computer simulation mods. Low FPS can greatly hurt how the game actually calculates, rather than just looks or feels. 

And that's why in some video games very high FPS can mess up your main menus or physics simulations (Fallout 4 and Skyrim infamous for this). In this case, VSync can help. If you run on 60 or 120, then using NVidia's VSync adaptive half refresh rate is your best option. This forces you down to 30 or 60, respectively, but turns it on and off depending on whether or not you need it and keeps the math running smoothly. 

You can greatly notice a difference in game stability in higher FPS's (60 or more) in heavily modded Skyrim or Fallout 4. Because any mod that runs Papyrus scripts will majorly benefit from a higher FPS.

And in that sense, people who claim that lowering their graphics settings helps their mods are actually not crazy at all. They might not know how it works, but they are correct.","",""

The idea: I've run into quite a few errors with Love2D updates so far and find myself doing a lot of bug searching every time I start a new module.

I was hoping to compile a resource of all the tweak's a student must make to their system and environment to get straight to the GD50 classwork. I wanted to include an official guide, supplemented by a forum, where we take the most asked questions and topic and compile them into wiki pages. Then, I hope to include IDE guides on how to setup Love2D as of it's current update in various popular IDEs like Notepad++, Eclipse LDT, Visual Studio Community / Code, and a ton more. 

I can't even fathom how to begin doing this, and was hoping I could rally a small team to help me with this. It's not for me, but for the future of this class and the future of the game dev community. I hope a resource like this can help keep people from getting discouraged and giving up. I know if I hadn't been programming for 17 years and using a PC for 25, there's no way I would have made it to module 3. But this class doesn't assume you have a lifetime of experience like me, it assumes you just came from CS50 as a programming freshie, so I think the amount of technical knowledge it takes just to get the examples running is enough to discourage many people. And that's why I'd like to create this resource. 

If anyone would like to help, add me here on Discord and I'll make a channel if I get enough people interested. Then I'll hand out my personal email as needed and we can coordinate an effort.

"333842064150102026","LicensedToThrill#1059","18-Aug-18 09:02 PM","Watching breakout, someone had a question about how to run Love2D as ""love . "" instead of the full path on Windows. No need to use VSCode if you use something else. Just run from PowerShell (you really should ditch cmd at this point, make PowerShell your default console, it comes with Windows). and create a PowerShell profile (Google tutorials) and add this line to it: "" new-item alias:love -value ""C:\Program Files\LOVE\love.exe"" "" -- careful with the quotes. Your PS profile can be found in Documents / Windows Power Shell / profile.ps1 or whatever you named it. 

You can use the profile to do many cool things like create different python commands for 2.7 and 3 (I use py for 2.7 and ppy for 3) and I use npp to run notepad++. Typing npp thisfile.txt creates a new file called thisfile.txt. Works with .lua .py or anything. You can use PowerShell to automatically start in your Love dev directory too. Mine also shows the current path on the title bar and the process number. Use the line set-location to set a custom location to start in.","",""

Turns out % doesn't actually return a remainder unless the x / y is 1 or higher. The actual formula according to Lua docs is : a % b == a - math.floor(a/b)*b, meaning that the second half always defaults to 0 if the modulo is (smallernumber / biggernumber), so Lua calculates it as smallnumber - 0, and just returns smallnumber.","",""

I'm almost done. It teaches you a lot of core game design concepts and genres. The assignments are really clever in forcing you to understand most of the code to be able to  implement the additions. You finish the course knowing a lot of important game concepts that are interchangeable among tech stacks, and with a good understanding on how to code games in Lua, + a good foundation to learn more about how to code in Unity.  I personally liked the focus on the ""theory"" as there's a ton of other resources to learn the modern game engines.
Downside of these big assignments are that when I got stuck it would sometimes take me a ton of hours (or days) to troubleshoot - not sure if it's the most efficient way to learn, but it's pretty satisfying to finish them.","",""

I'm working on Breakout now, and I tried fiddling around with the StateMachine code, removing self.empty and just setting self.current to self.states['start']. But problem there is that on start of the game, you actually want to start the game by loading highscores and passing them into StartState, which, given how the States are structured,  should be done by passing it in to StartState:enter as a parameter. 

So to do that, you have to initialize the state machine with an empty state, so that you can use StateMachine:change() to switch to StartState, which will then call StartState's enter function.","",""

Our main function (in `main.lua`) to detect input:
```function love.keypressed(key)

    love.keyboard.keysPressed[key] = true

    if key == 'escape' then
        love.event.quit()

In this case, we could've just used `love.keyboard.keysPressed` instead of making another function i.e:
```function love.keyboard.wasPressed(key)
    return love.keyboard.keysPressed[key]

I grabbed 0.10.2 from here: https://bitbucket.org/rude/love/downloads/, I downloaded the love-0.10.2-macosx-x64.zip, unzipped it and copied it to my applications folder. I've just tried it now and noticed that dragging and dropping doesn't seem to work with this version, but I do it from the command line. So try `/Applications/love.app/Contents/MacOS/love ~/path/to/mygame` and see if that works (assuming you called the love2d app ""love"". If it does you can add love to your path, there are instructions here: https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started
@Ben Attenborough Amazing, thank you! Honestly I have no idea why this worked when what I did didn't (since I tried both command line and not, with the same version)... It might be because it's in the Application folder specifically? Mine was just in Downloads. Anyways, either way you're a lifesaver and now I can continue the course!","",""

@toofaildev yes, I kinda solved it changing a bit the collide function, checking if the ball future location would pass the paddle and updating its position. 
Now the problem resides on both AI's playing infinitelly to the point in which the ball becomes invisible for us humans, but the AI's keep playing xD

"267286545982160896","WickedRainG#7816","24-Apr-20 05:11 PM","So I finally figured out how to upload the project from git cmd:
1. Navigate to the assignment folder
2. `git init` <- This initializes the folder you're in as a git repo
3. `git add .` <- This adds all of the files in the current directory to a commit
4. `git commit` <- This commits the changes you have made
5. `git checkout -b games50/assignments/2020/x/0` <- This creates the new branch, or checks out to the branch if it already exists
6. `git remote add origin https://github.com/me50/USERNAME.git` <- This adds the remote repository, also replace ""USERNAME"" with your github username 
7. `git remote -v` <- This verifies the remote repo you just added
8. `git pull` <- This pulls anything from the remote repo to your local repo
9. `git fetch` <- I'm not sure if this is necessary but this fetches the latest meta-data from the origin
10. `git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/games50/assignments/2020/x/0` <- Not 100% what this does, but I guess it sets the upstream of your current local branch, to the specified remote branch
11. `git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories` <- This pulls anything from the remote repo to your local repo, but the `--allow-unrelated-histories` option allows it to merge unrelated histories, which is basically because the remote repo and local repo aren't the same currently (Correct me if I'm wrong)
12. `git push --set-upstream origin games50/assignments/2020/x/0` <- This will push your project to the branch specified
I'm not sure if any of the commands I used are redundant, but this worked for me, hope it works for you guys.","",""

> So I finally figured out how to upload the project from git cmd:
> 1. Navigate to the assignment folder
> 2. `git init` <- This initializes the folder you're in as a git repo
> 3. `git add .` <- This adds all of the files in the current directory to a commit
> 4. `git commit` <- This commits the changes you have made
> 5. `git checkout -b games50/assignments/2020/x/0` <- This creates the new branch, or checks out to the branch if it already exists
> 6. `git remote add origin https://github.com/me50/USERNAME.git` <- This adds the remote repository, also replace ""USERNAME"" with your github username 
> 7. `git remote -v` <- This verifies the remote repo you just added
> 8. `git pull` <- This pulls anything from the remote repo to your local repo
> 9. `git fetch` <- I'm not sure if this is necessary but this fetches the latest meta-data from the origin
> 10. `git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/games50/assignments/2020/x/0` <- Not 100% what this does, but I guess it sets the upstream of your current local branch, to the specified remote branch
> 11. `git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories` <- This pulls anything from the remote repo to your local repo, but the `--allow-unrelated-histories` option allows it to merge unrelated histories, which is basically because the remote repo and local repo aren't the same currently (Correct me if I'm wrong)
> 12. `git push --set-upstream origin games50/assignments/2020/x/0` <- This will push your project to the branch specified
> I'm not sure if any of the commands I used are redundant, but this worked for me, hope it works for you guys.

"444082313832431646","Sky#2459","27-Apr-20 05:38 PM","@SLY_R2 @ʙʟᴜᴇ  love.keypressed() is a love2d function that detects keystrokes, you have to overload the function and make it do something else like in pong, if the key is 'escape' it will quite the game. 

However love.keypressed() is usually only written once in the main.lua file. It would be very tedious to write every behaviour for every key on the keyboard, moreover you may want each key to behave differently in each states. You may overload this function in other files, but it will be hard to keep track of which is the definition of the function you want currently. It is a bad practice in programming to overload functions too many times.

So in order to detect keystrokes in other files, we need to define new functions our own. We need to extend the function by storing the keystrokes in love.keyboard.keysPressed(key), and then define another function called love.keyboard.wasPressed(key) that returns true if the key you want is pressed, so then you can check for keystrokes in multiple files with the love.keyboard.wasPressed(key) function, which is extended from love.keypressed(key), while only writing it once! Hope this clears your 'lostness'","",""

Also, I took a glimpse of Mario, and with the spritesheet/quad thing is monstrous to sort of difficult to grasp. That it's hard to implement those by myself. I suddenly doubted myself if I really understand programming at all. In Breakout, I tried typing myself line by line, the first part was a breeze. the start state where just swapping the colors between the buttons and the scaling of the background image. But when the code becomes complex to read and implement. Lots of parameters, arguments, function calls. Definitely I can't make this by myself.

```lua
 love.keyboard.keysPressed = {}
```
It's clear in this code's comment that this adds keys to the table:
```lua
function love.keypressed(key)
 -- add to our table of keys pressed this frame
    love.keyboard.keysPressed[key] = true
 
 if key == 'escape' then
        love.event.quit()
 end
end
```
I don't understand how that adds to the table. I was thinking in the previous topics, it was clear we add to the table with`table.insert()`
Also, Is my understanding correct that since `love.keypressed(key)` is a love module, it checks for every keypress this frame. Is that the reason why we put the inserting of key to the table inside of that function?

Now, this code returns the value in the table:
 ```lua
function love.keyboard.wasPressed(key)
  if love.keyboard.keysPressed[key] then
 return true
 else
  return false
 end
end
```
Which comes first? That previous code, or the code key call in Bird.lua?:
 
```lua
if love.keyboard.wasPressed('space') then
 self.dy = -5
 end
```
This is where I get confused. So, we declared parameters and calls them with the argument in Bird.lua? Or did I interchange it? Appreciate any enlightenment on this.","",""
