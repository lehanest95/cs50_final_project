My form has two text inputs, two select inputs, and 5 radio buttons. When using
!document.querySelector('input' or 'select').value the js will only catch if the first text input and the first select input are empty. 

I resolved this by using giving each text and select input an id attribute and using that. 

However, I cannot figure out a way to check if  at least one of the radio buttons is selected. I've tried selecting the value (with querySelector) using id, class, and just a board 'input"". but nothing seems to work. Any advice? Thanks in advance!","",""

```js
if (Array.prototype.every.call(document.getElementsByName(""position""), item => !item.checked)) {
    alert(""Select Position"");

}
```
`Array.prototype.every.call(arrayLike, fun)` is a way to do `arrayLike.every(fun)` for something that's not an array, just array-like. The array methods are written in a way that most of them will work on any array-like if you want. Doing `arr.every(fun)` would internally do the same (actually calling a method uses the same internal structure as `apply`, not `call`, which takes arguments stored in an array-like, not a parameter list with all separate, but is otherwise the same)

`item => !item.checked` is almost same as function expression `function(item) { return !item.checked; }`, it's a more compact notation introduced in ECMAScript 2015.","","❤ (1)"

In Python, it's pretty similar, just completely different. Python does not clearly differentiate between static and member methods (does so implicitly via first parameter for methods which is named `self` by convention), and Python supports inheriting from multiple classes.","",""
