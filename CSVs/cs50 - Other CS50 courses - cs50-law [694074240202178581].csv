I'm not a lawyer, although I'm about to finish college. But please note that the course page also recommends it for Law students, which is my case; also, Law in Brazil is an undergraduate level course, so it's not as far up the academic road as it is in America.
But yeah, I'll try my best to acquire the necessary knowlegde in order to perform well in the course.
It's sad that not as many people take CS50L when compared to other courses,  and we don't have a particularly active community, which is the reason why I had to turn to you guys from the staff to get help.
Anyway, I intend to proceed with the course, and I am really thankful for your assistance.","",""

"404050504478490624","rj2808#5718","19-Apr-20 11:56 PM","Hi @MarcelH. The ""big-oh"" notation is a mathematical function used in computer science to represent the performance of an algorithm. For example, and in the context of searching the phonebook, if your algorithm is programmed to search every page for a specific name, then you would represent the performance of this algorithm as O(n). If, like in the lecture, your algorithm cut the phonebook in half, then its performance would be O(log n). I hope this makes sense, but if it did not, here are a few resources that I found online : https://rob-bell.net/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation/, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/big-o-notation-simply-explained-with-illustrations-and-video-87d5a71c0174/","","üëç (3)"

@Alex Ratanak it all boils down to my man George Boole. his philosophy was more of a higher power which reflected in all his work. do you believe, yes or no, 1 or 0. that's what the binary code and all modern computers are based on, pseudo code is more human logic","","üëç (1)"
