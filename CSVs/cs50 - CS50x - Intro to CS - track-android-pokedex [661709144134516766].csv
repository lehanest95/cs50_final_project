I has previous programming experience but I still got lost and it took me a whole day to just get the syntax right...

 getting lost isn't a big worry at all.

I feel like this is a video demonstrating how he does a code rather than explaining it, what has everyone else done? Go do another Java course? Do an Android Studio course? Any specific suggestion for courses? 

This is honestly a bit discouraging. The first 8 weeks are so well explained and even though they are challenging you feel very rewarded when you complete the pset for the week. This feels like if someone started CS50 on week 3 or 4, should I just give up on mobile app for now and move to the Web track?","",""
