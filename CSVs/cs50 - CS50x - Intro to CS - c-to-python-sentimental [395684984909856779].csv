Hey guys i am trying to do crack.py with recurrsion and its saying: `maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object`

it stops after `r *` (this is string of size 2)

does this mean python is bad for recurssion? , i am saying this because in #crack i remember a guy was saying that he solved the problem with recurssion in `C`

Here is the actual error:

In the C version, I had 5 different functions, corresponding to the 5 different lengths N that the string could take on (1 to 5). There was a lot of redundant code, but I couldn't figure out how to condense everything into one function.

With Python, I've been looking at stuff like itertools, and permutations algorithms that handle sets AND all possible subsets, but I've just been getting more confused.
Are there any tips on how I can write this elegantly? My current thought is that I should just have one function that handles strings of length 5, with conditions where if the string is of length 4, it skips the outermost loop and just loops through the inner 4, and so forth for lengths 3, 2, and 1.

I'm also not quite sure how your first solution would work for my ""elegance"" problem. To be extremely clear, my code works, but I have one function with 5 for loops, one function with 4 for loops... and so forth, but ideally I simply want just one function with 5 loops that handles all string lengths. 

If I follow your instruction, using the 5 for loop function, and I go to the deepest loop, I don't see how that covers any other case but the string length of 5 case.","",""
"49375778571292672","MY EYES#5465","06-Oct-19 05:20 AM","@fattytuna7 Alright, let's simplify the problem and pretend we need a function that can handle either 1 or 2 char passwords. The pseudocode would go something like this:

```function():
    make empty string
    outer loop (for second char):
        inner loop (for first char):
            edit first char of string
            check if string matches password (if so, return)
        edit second char of string```

First, the inner loop will loop the first character of the string from a-z, checking if any of the iterations matches the password. If the inner loop goes all the way to the end without finding the password, that's it: you've covered every possible 1 char password, and you're now ready to move on to 2 char passwords.

The function then moves out to the outer loop. The outer loop will edit the second char once, then go back in to the inner loop to go through every possible iteration of the first char once again, but this time, the string also has a second char. This repeats until the second char has also gone through a-z.

You can extend the possible length of the password just by nesting more and more loops with this same structure. Try writing something that prints every possible 1 or 2 char password to the console using this method.","",""
"572968294424903680","fattytuna7#9460","07-Oct-19 01:10 AM","@MY EYES How can we move from the outer loop to the inner loop with a ""blank"" for the outer loop? 

Specifically, for the 3rd line of your code, what are you iterating over? I iterate `from char ""a"" to char ""z""` (for lowercase), or in python terms, something like `for letter in range(ord('z') - ord('a'))`. Then in the very first iteration as we step into the outer loop, `letter` is already taking on a value, which gets plugged into the final string, and of course we get another letter when we step into the inner loop.

Is it that you are separating your iterator variable from how you're modifying the string? That is, you simply have `for i in range(52)` and `for j in range(52)` for your two loops, and then inside the loops, you have some `letter_1` and `letter_2` variables?

Also, how are you editing your string variable above? If you're doing what I've stated above are you just doing `newstring = letter_1 + letter_2`?","",""
"49375778571292672","MY EYES#5465","07-Oct-19 05:17 AM","@fattytuna7 You're getting closer. If you look at the placement of the `edit second char of string` line, the trick is that the outer loop's `letter` (the second char) *doesn't* get plugged into the final string until we've gone through the inner loop once. At which point, we've already covered every 1 char password.

If the ""empty string” we declare at the top is called `final_string`,  we can edit specific characters by accessing it through an index like this:
```# Changes first char of string to letter
final_string[0] = letter```
You don't necessarily need to declare separate letter variables inside the loops aside from the iterators, since you can plug the value directly into the string without assigning it to another variable first. But that's up to you; if you think it makes your code more readable, go for it.","",""

"572968294424903680","fattytuna7#9460","09-Oct-19 02:19 AM","@MY EYES I still don't see how the solution you proposed can work.

If indeed I follow your instruction and not declare separate letter variables inside the loops (the iterators are the letter variables), then the fact that `edit second char of string` comes after we've gone through the inner loop once is irrelevant. The iterator for the second char of the string was set as ""A""  when we went through the outer loop. Explicitly:

```def iterate_two(salt, userhash):
    for letter_1 in range(ord(""A""), ord(""z"")):
        for letter_2 in range(ord(""A""), ord(""z"")):
            key = chr(letter_1) + chr(letter_2)```

I mean having `edit second char of string` as something you're doing in a separate line (rather than having the outer loop iteration handle this) seems to suggest you definitely need separate letter variables other than the iterator variables, since you're essentially trying to decouple the outer loop iteration from the editing of the second char of the string. This seems to get kind of messy.","",""
"49375778571292672","MY EYES#5465","09-Oct-19 08:28 AM","@fattytuna7 The problem is that we don't want to insert both chars into the string at the same time like in your example, since that only allows us to check 2 char strings. Assuming you initialized `key` as an empty global variable, we can set the inner loop's edit statement to this, following the advice from that stackoverflow link from before:

```key = chr(letter_2) + key[1:]```
Which sets `key`'s first char to be the inner loop's current `letter_2`, and appends whatever else was already in `key` from position 1 onward to the end of it. If the key is only 1 char long (as in, we haven't finished the inner loop once yet), `key[1:]` will return nothing, which means we still have a 1 char `key` for us to check. But once we start plugging `letter_1` into `key`, this will allow the inner loop to take part in handling 2 char passwords as well.

I'm not sure what you mean by ""trying to decouple the outer loop iteration""? The `edit second char of string` line is still within the bounds of the outer loop, which allows the line to access the `letter_1` variable. This line will look fairly similar to the one above.","",""

`x = a > b and y or z`

I don't plan to use it, but I was hoping I could ask what is actually happening here.  Maybe something like... It tries to evaluate everything to the right of the '=' as a boolean, so if the condition is fulfilled then (a>b and y) is true, and the right hand side of the ""or"" doesn't even run, but if the conditional is false, then does it set x = y, and then set x = z?  What happens if y = 0?  Will the ""and"" expression return false, and then set x = z?  Or is it that the successful assignment of x = y returns true?

`print(x = a > b and y or z)`

would print true in both cases?","",""

First it does the 'and', because that's the order of precedence.  So it does the comparator first.  If it's true, then I think it sets x = a>b = true, then continues with the second half of the 'and'.  Ah, so this is coming back to what we did in C!  Since 0 has a value (is not null), then that is true as well.  As it tests it, it also assigns x = 0.

It has completed the 'and', so it moves onto the 'or'.

It most languages, it won't evaluate both sides of an 'or' if the first side is true (because it can already see that the 'or' is true).  So it just finishes, and the last assignment was x = 0.

If the comparator a>b is false, it sets x = false.  Then it doesn't have to test the second term because the 'and' will still return false because of the first result.  So it moves to the 'or', and it evaluates 1 as a boolean, an in the process sets x = 1.","",""

```key= lambda element: element[1]```

```key= lambda thing: thing[1]```
would have the same effect.

It's not item[1] that's being passed in as a key.  It's the entire functional process ""item -> item[1]"".  The syntax essentially means ""for each thing that we are sorting, look at the thing's second element in it's array, and use that to sort the things"".","",""

`for t in text:` would first get an iterator for the (iterable) value of `text`, an object that will walk the string. Then, the loop will request items from the iterator (in this case single characters), and assign them to `t`, until the iterator is exhausted (at the string's end).
Same with `for i in range(len(text)):`, `range` returns an iterator (and an iterator, asked for an iterator, will return itself). So if you changed `i` in the loop, it would not have any effect on the following iterations, as the state is kept in the iterator.","","👍 (1)"

Lets say i have input that is an integer  and I want to declare a function that will check what is the digit in desired position. For example my input is number: 1234
position: 1
Expected output is as it has to be 
Postion 1 digit value is 1.
But when my input is like 
Number: 1234
Position: 2
I want to print both 1st and 2nd digit so the output should be ""12"". However i print only the 1st position which is 1 and that is wrong. My print if statement is OK. The problem is in my function. My def contains of a while loop, if statements for both position 1 and 2 and a formula that decrease the input number depends of which position i need. 
A=true
while a 
   number = number // 10
   If pos == 1 
       If  number // 10 == 0
            a = False
            Return number
   If pos == 2
       If number // 100 == 0
             a = False
             return number

This seems to return twice the 1st digit of the integer inputed in case pos input is 2. I need 1st and 2nd pos in this case not twice the 1st.","",""
