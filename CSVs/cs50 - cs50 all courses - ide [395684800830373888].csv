I was wondering if there was a reason for this/is this normal behavior on this docker image? 

I've run this on Macbook Pro 2016 (no touchbar) so the system isn't too old, but it takes at least 10-15 minutes where it just hangs - and then I randomly type in some character (2) and it prods along to the next step where it completes installation normally and then prompts me to restart the Docker image. 

I haven't let it just sit for the duration to see if it resumes automatically, so I'm not sure if my typing is prompting it to skip some sequence and perform other tasks, but I wanted to check-in to see if this was a bug on my end or something the Offline IDE has been known to demonstrate.

"393854278764068875","curiouskiwi#1671","05-Nov-18 11:57 PM","When called without any arguments, break sets a breakpoint at the next instruction to be executed in the selected stack frame (see section Examining the Stack). In any selected frame but the innermost, this makes your program stop as soon as control returns to that frame. This is similar to the effect of a finish command in the frame inside the selected frame--except that finish does not leave an active breakpoint. If you use break without an argument in the innermost frame, GDB stops the next time it reaches the current location; this may be useful inside loops. GDB normally ignores breakpoints when it resumes execution, until at least one instruction has been executed. If it did not do this, you would be unable to proceed past a breakpoint without first disabling the breakpoint. This rule applies whether or not the breakpoint already existed when your program stopped.","",""

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the ""hello-world"" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

I am trying to link Clion with lib50 (using windows).
When I am running `make install` here's what I am getting:

```mkdir -p /usr/local/src /usr/local/lib /usr/local/include /usr/local/share/man/man3
cp -r  /usr/local
cp: missing destination file operand after '/usr/local'
Try 'cp --help' for more information.
make: *** [Makefile:46: install] Error 1```

I did add this string `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib` to my `.bashrc` file. At least I hope that I did it right. 

Please, I am really need your advice. I want to be able to solve the PSETS locally on my machine as it is much more useful than via sandbox. Please, advice üòÉ","",""

I like to write my code in vscode, and then paste it into cs50 ide or the python terminal for testing. I stated having indentation issues, and realized upon pasting the code into sublime text that for some reason, vscode seems to sometimes make several single spaces even though I'm only using tab to indent. Does anyone else have similar issues? 

I really want to use vscode if possible, but I'll gladly take recommendations for other IDEs as well","",""

DeprecationWarning: 'werkzeug.contrib.fixers.ProxyFix' has moved to 'werkzeug.middleware.proxy_fix.ProxyFix'. This import is deprecated as of version 0.15 and will be removed in 1.0.

I was able to determine that the werkzeug version used in the new ide is 0.15.0 where as the legacy ide uses 0.14.1. The deprecation warning suggests that the werkzeug.contrib.fixers.ProxyFix import has been moved to werkzeug.middleware.proxy_fix.ProxyFix. Problem is I do not have read/write access to the flask.py file located at.../opt/pyenv/versions/3.7.2/lib/python3.7/site-packages/cs50/flask.py

Anyone else run into this issue when migrating? Or perhaps have any suggestions on how to resolve?

`#import <cs50.h>` in the C code would tell the preprocessor to include the cs50 header, found in some standard library directory (if it were in the current directory, you would use quotation marks instead of angle brackets around the name). Make sure to not add any spaces directly around the file name. `< cs50.h >` looks pretty but does not work.
And compile with `-lcs50` added to the compile command, to tell the linker to link against the cs50 library as well. That last part happens automatically if you compile using `make` on the IDE50 environment (due to `make` using an environment variable with that option).","",""

https://gyazo.com/b822541350425f55290bfddb0d22bec1

On my laptop I created an ""untitled.1"" file on the CS50 IDE and copied some code I had written on the CS50 sandbox inside it. 
I saved the file as ""untitled.1"" and then tried renaming it to ""test.c"" but accidentally named it "".c"" instead. 
As soon as I did that a bunch of other files, which I had never seen before, popped up on`~/`
I attempted to delete those files, but deleted every file on `~/` as well.
I moved to my desktop, since I had my code for a pset backed up on to it, which still had the tab open.
I copied the code and recreated a directory for the pset and pasted the code into it.
I then started getting error messages when I tried saving the code, so I copied my code to pastebin and refreshed the IDE.
The IDE informed me that it had to run the installer so I hit ok.
Now I get the following:
```
Failed Bash. Exit code 100

One or more errors occured. Please try to resolve them and restart AWS Cloud9 or visit https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=268

But when submitting it, the check50 on the submit website showed errors. I resubmitted several times (~4) with the same exact code, each time I would get a different score with check50 on this page: https://submit.cs50.io/users/tomswim/cs50/problems/2019/x/sentimental/credit.

I worked on crack.py for a while, replacing all the credit code with the new code for crack. I saved it and ran it in the IDE several times as I was adding the new code. I got it to print out the salt and the hashed password, and replaced all the credit code that had been there. At one point after this the IDE had to reconnect, after it reconnected pset6/crack/crack.py file was still there, but now when I click on it to display its code, it only shows the original credit.py code that I had started with. It did not show any of the new code I had added/replaced it with. And the very odd thing is if I go to that directory in the IDE, run ""python crack.py lksdjflhdsg"" it runs the crack code, I can tell because it prints out the salt and the hash that I had working previously, but that code is not seen in that file. I have cleared the cache on Chrome, restarted the browser several times and tried from a second computer. Still saw the same thing, When I clicked on crack.py it displays the original credit code but runs the crack code I had finished in my last successful save before the reconnect. What worked was to duplicate that file in the IDE, and the duplicate file had all the new crack code so I completed and submitted the problem with that file.","",""

if we use this implementation of lock_pairs, than we get right output

```

    bool flags_w[pair_count];

        flags_l[i] = false;
        flags_w[i] = false;

    }
    for (int i = 0; i < pair_count; i++)
    {
        locked[pairs[i].winner][pairs[i].loser] = true;
        //flags[pairs[i].winner] = true;

        flags_w[pairs[i].winner] = true;

        /*while (flags[pairs[i + 1].loser])
        {
            i++;
        }*/

1. The first line of the file needs a Shebang ‚Üí https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_%28Unix%29
2. The current user in the Unix session needs to have permissions to execute the file, use this command to grant permissions ‚Üí `chmod +x /path/to/the/file`
3. The Shebang needs to point to a previously installed program

For example:

Let‚Äôs say you want to make a Python script called `‚Äúprogram.py‚Äù` executable. Following the steps described above you would end up with something like this:

```
$ cat program.py

I created my own hash table in a separate program to understand how it actually works because I struggled for one week to bring the pseudocode to code. I finally made it and I am trying to use Valgrind because it's part of the project. I was able to free all allocated memory and most of mistakes. However:
||```c
node *temp = NULL;
char *pos;
    for (int index = 0; index < N ; index++)
    {
        temp = table[index];
        while (temp != NULL)
        {
            printf("" %p "", temp);
            pos = temp->word;
            while (*pos != '\0')
            {
                printf(""%c"", *(pos++)); // ERROR SUMMARY
            }
            printf("" -"");
            temp = temp->next;
        }
        printf(""\n"");
    }
```||
If I do it in that way (As David does in the lecture 4, min 38)

I tried many different  things (Like printing the whole string just pointing to the first character without the ""while (*pos != '\0')"", etc) but nothing seems to work. Any idea about the solution?
PS: This is not part of the speller exercise actually (or at least part of the ""load function"") but I want to understand how Hash tables work (which I did) and Valgrind too.

 I have the next problem with Valgrind:","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/395684800830373888/706125035479498804/SPOILER_ValgrindPrueba.png",""
