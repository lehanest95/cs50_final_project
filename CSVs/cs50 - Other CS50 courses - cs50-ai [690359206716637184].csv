I am not sure whether this has been touched on already or not, but I would like to ask you about recommended readings for the course. I would like to start the course as it will kick off, but I also would like to dig deeper in the different topics. Could you please recommend me some books / articles which might be beneficial for extending on the knowledge delivered by each week's subjects?

Kind Thanks,
Andras","",""

We have David doing ```temp = realloc(list, 4 * sizeof(int));``` followed by `list = temp;` then `temp[3] = 4`. Is the reason we are doing it this way is because when assigning temp to list, the pointer information is lost? so we can't do `list[3] = 4`? I'm just trying to make sure I understand why this was done after `list = temp` or no real reason and it was just a preference approach.","",""

@Kensocolo the idea is to abstract the data that we see ""obvious"" into data that the computer can read well and understand. Basically we are telling the computer that (A)=1 means A is a mine, and (B)=0 is a safe square, where A, B are cells of the board. So, in case that we are sure that there's a mine in A,  and there's a mine in (A,B) (meaning A or B), then the computer realizes that (B)=0 meaning B is safe, otherwise (A,B) would be 2, not 1.","",""

I know that if ||`self.count` is 0, then I can return `set()`, since all of the cells are safe. Also, if `self.count` is equal to `len(self.cells)`, then all of the cells are not safe.|| Am I right?

I've got it in the Minimax and currently have my system set up as follows: I go through all of the possible options in a function within each loop like score = minimax2(board, depth +1, False) where the board applys the next move (on a deep copy), then False is saying that the next step will be the other player, the depth +1 takes into account that another move is being made. What I'm struggling to do from this function is once I get the optimal score, how do I translate this back and then only output the move?","",""

I've been moving forward with the degrees project, i think i got it working, but there are some combinations that take lots of time, which was your approach for optimizing it? I already applied the suggestion of returning the solution if the node that is evaluated for being added in the frontier is the target node... 
for example the path from: 
Tom Hanks (ID: 158) to Gary Cooper (ID: 7261390) takes for ever, for both Queue and Stack approaches

"468854718672666644","matthias#7993","11-Apr-20 09:24 PM","I guess the reason for the bad performance of the search algorithm is that the `QueueFrontier` implementation is not efficient at all. On every remove, it create a copy of the complete frontier, which can be tens of thousands of elements long. Similarly, if you check every time before adding a new item to the frontier, it will perform a linear-time lookup on the frontier. That's super expensive!

If you want to speed things up, I recommend using a `deque`. That's a kind of doubly linked list from python's standard library. You can use it like so:
```
from collections import deque

frontier = deque()
frontier.appendleft('node')
frontier.pop()
```
Using that instead of the `QueueFrontier` improved the running time by orders of magitude for me.","","👍 (1)"

@jfarrell138 You should be creating a score to come math.inf to, this is the trick. Essentially you want to go through the potential scores of going through all moves and see if you will return a better score than what's being found.

If the person has one GJB2 gene (x) and the parents each one gene as well, than it would be like ""xo,xo"" from the pool of available genes and I somehow have to come up with xo in the kid. than I see possible offsprings with xx, xo, ox and oo. to get to an xo state I would have:
xx -> one mutation -> ox
xx -> one mutation -> xo
xo -> no mutation -> xo
xo -> two mutations -> ox
ox -> no mutation -> ox
ox -> two mutations -> xo
oo -> one mutation -> ox
oo -> one mutation -> xo

so the likelike hood of getting one gene as a kid if both parents have each one would be: 4*one_mutation + 2*no_mutation + 2*two_mutaions

I am working on Project2a and I have some trouble undersatnding what is asked in the specifications.

At one point, the specs say ""You will likely want to pass the previous sample into your `transition_model` function"". So can `{'1.html': 0.05, '2.html': 0.475, '3.html': 0.475}` be a sample? If so, then How do we pass that sample to `transition_model`?

The specs say that `transition_model` takes ""The corpus is a Python dictionary **mapping a page name to a set of all pages** linked to by that page"". So the sample example above won't work as an argument for `transition_model`.

From the top middle cell, we have {A, B, C} = 1. From the bottom middle cell, we have {A, B, C, D, E} = 2. Logically, we could then infer a new piece of knowledge, that {D, E} = 1. After all, if two of A, B, C, D, and E are mines, and only one of A, B, and C are mines, then it stands to reason that exactly one of D and E must be the other mine.

More generally, any time we have two sentences set1 = count1 and set2 = count2 where set1 is a subset of set2, then we can construct the new sentence set2 - set1 = count2 - count1. Consider the example above to ensure you understand why that’s true.","",""

@DJMANTA Hi, how did you go about calculating the prob of a gene in the child? I'm getting all the right values except for ""Harry"".

@DJMANTA For BFS it has to be  O(b^(d + 1)) (wiki), where b is average node children and d(worst case) is a distance (degrees of separation).
Let b equal 6 and d equal 8, in this case big O will be O(6^9), and I'm not adding nodes to frontier that are already explored so it has to be smaller","",""

Our random surfer now starts by choosing a page at random, and then, for each additional sample we’d like to generate, chooses a link from the current page at random with probability d, and chooses any page at random with probability 1 - d.
