An entry-level course taught by David J. Malan, CS50 AP teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. The on-campus version of CS50 AP, CS50 itself, is Harvard's largest course.
 
Students in high school may receive AP credit for this course provided their school approves the credit and administers the College Board's end-of-year exam. Students who earn a satisfactory score (70% or higher) on each of the course's assigned problems","",""

And that also means we can compare argv[2][0] against a variety of possible values (such as +, -, x, / or %, for example) and make certain decisions in our program based on what that character is, perhaps by making use of some Boolean expressions and conditional statements. (Of course, since there are only a small number of characters that we care about in argv[2][0], you might also find this a good opportunity to use a switch statement for perhaps the first time.)\

Speaking of show_banner, why don’t we also peek at show_cursor. Recall that functions like mvaddch and mvaddstr end up moving your cursor in order to add text to the screen. That’s kind of annoying if you want to use that same cursor to play the actual game. And so it is necessary to remember where the cursor should be with respect to the grid. Glance back at that global called g and you’ll see how we do it. This show_cursor function relies on that struct to return the cursor to where it should be after screen updates.

If indeed you successfully found key inside the file, open an outfile called found.txt for appending, not writing. (This way every time you open and write to the file, you will not overwrite any file names already stored in there.)

Copy the name of the file where you found the string into found.txt. You should additionally add a newline character at the end to ensure separation of each file name.

Additionally, you will only want to write a file name into your outfile once, even if the string is found in multiple locations within that same file, so perhaps you can devise an easy way keep track of whether or not[5] you’ve already output that file.

```
Just to preface this I think that Canada's university is the US's college. 

1. Exam/Next year
I'm currently starting unit 3. It's my understand that I've already passed the date at Which my school can email cs50 for the exam. My exam coordinator has said that I could write the exam but I don't think I have enough time to finish the course and study for the exam.  If I reinroll in the class next year, can I simply resubmit what I've completed so far and then study and prepare for the exam and take it?

2. Is the AP level credit worth it
As a Canadian planning to go to a Canadian university is it worth it for myself to even get the actual credit? I went down to guidance and the person I talked to had no idea what to say. What would this course be classified as to university? How can I tell if this credit would help me? Or would it be better if I just got the certificate from edX. For comparision I'm in grade 10.

3. Exam Prep
Assuming I can complete the course next year, how should I go about preparing for the exam?

I guess my overall question is: is it worth it for myself to peruse the actual academic way of receiving certification. Or should I just get the certificate and use it as a part of my application while applying to university

Thanks so much!

Some of the naming on the course isn't consistent. Also the edX course isn't clearly defined and laid out like a ~36 week AP course for high schools. The edX ""AP"" course still holds on to most of the 10 week Harvard schedule which makes it a little tricky for teachers trying to figure out pacing if they wanted to use it along  with what they teach and support in class.  All that was probably explained in the Teacher workshops but I wasn't able to go since the one closest to me was canceled this year.

All that being said.... I think it is a great curriculum with LOTS of resources but for a busy teacher that might be new to the AP, or in some cases a math teacher who hasn't taught a CS course before, it could be tricky and unsettling.  ... Just my $0.02.","","👍 (1),👌 (1)"
