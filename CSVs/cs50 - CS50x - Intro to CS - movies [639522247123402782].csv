And then you want all movies with those movie_ids

Recall that you can run a select query with `WHERE ... IN` to match a single column to a list of values.

`SELECT title FROM books WHERE title IN (list one)`
for example, and that you can use  WHERE with an AND if you have multiple lists.

WHERE x IN y AND x in z  which would return only items present in both.  Can you see how you can combine these ideas to get your answer?","",""

@Era3tone cat will output your file to the terminal and the ""|"" is  a pipe, so what is actually happening is you output the data in filename.sql
so for example ""select * from movies""
the | will pipe it to the ""other side"" think of it as using the right side:
""sqlite3 movies.db"" with an argument (and the argument being the output of the left side)
so the result will be something like:
""sqlite3 movies.db select * from movies"" and that will get executed","","👍 (3)"

@John (Instructor) 
In that case, if I'm not wrong, you can only work in your ""where"" clause and restrict it Probably, you will to link both columns somehow, then specify what you want to take from Column B. I'm not sure if that is what you want. hehe","",""
