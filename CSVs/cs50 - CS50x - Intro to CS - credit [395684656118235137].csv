"403626422016671744","jason#9686","28-Jan-18 11:45 AM","I work in an agile team, we pair and use test driven development. When its working well, one person writes a test, the other then fixes the code and writes another test . The emphasis is always on keeping it simple and doing as little as possible to make the test pass. Occasionally, we will refactor either the code or the tests. As developers we are sometimes guilty of wanting to spend our time writing beautiful and perfect solutions rather than just getting the job done. This methodology helps avoid that pitfall. We do have some fun with it, challenging each other to do the minimum fix etc, if I can hard code a value to pass your test, then I'll do that, and then the test will get improved, or another added to defeat my hack.
So, I am used to coding to tests, and writing good tests that ensure that the code answers the requirements. We have a continuous integration (CI) pipeline where the tests  have to pass before your code can go to upstream environments. - so using check50 and then submit50 feels familiar to me. 
The whole basis of TDD is that if your tests don't match every condition in your acceptance criteria then you won't get good code and you then get buggy code being deployed. 
I'm used to spotting tests that don't ensure 100% code coverage and that is the case here. No bad code is getting deployed, just students maybe, sometimes getting a green when they should have a red.","",""

Okay, let’s multiply each of the underlined digits by 2:

7•2 + 2•2 + 2•2 + 4•2 + 3•2 + 0•2 + 0•2

That gives us:

14 + 4 + 4 + 8 + 6 + 0 + 0

1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 8 + 6 + 0 + 0 = 27

"395426133035843585","MrBadger#3037","01-May-18 05:25 PM","Could someone give me a nudge in the right direction on this problem please?

My approach at the moment is: 
1) use get_string to prompt the user for the card number. I have implemented testing for the correct lengths of input using strlen;
2) use a 'for' loop to iterate through the user-supplied number and populate a variable-length array with the digits that need to be multiplied by 2; 
3) (not quite sure how yet) - in the same 'for' loop, sum the card digits that do not need to be multiplied by 2, and store in a variable.
4) (again not sure how yet) - do the relevant math on the digits stored in the array (I imagine this ought to be relatively simple as I should be able to use mod to deal with any integers greater than 10) and add to the sum from #3. 
5) use mod 10 to check the final sum is divisible by 10; 
6) implement logic that takes outcome of #5 and uses it with the values of the 1st two card digits to print the card type.

I'm actually running into trouble with #2, and I haven't worked out how to convert my string characters to integers. Based on what happens when I multiply by 2 (eg my char ""1"" goes to 'b' (1 = 49; b = 98= 49 * 2)), I think it's interpreting my input as characters not integer values.

I have tried playing around with atoi, but have recently seen a bit of negative discussion of it (I think elsewhere on Discord). Also, the function doesn't seem to like what I'm feeding it.

If I'm on the right track (or one of the right tracks) could someone please give me a clue, or point me in the right direction?

1.  american express, master cards,paypal etc all are credit card ? 

2.  after recieving input, i have to check first if the total number of digits are valid or not.  example: for master digits should be 16, for visa digits should be 13 or 16. ( how to check the total number of digits ? do we have a function for that or just loops and conditions ? )  don't spoil me the answer just guide me. 

3.  now i apply luhn's algo and check if the last digit is 0 or not.  if 0 then good else false.

Conversely, while reading through discussions and other example solutions, it looks like others are using functions and libraries that haven't been covered in the material yet to create a better optimized processes.

The  'more comfortable' problems are meant to be a challenge for students who might find the 'less comfortable' too easy.   I know that many students feel they have to complete everything, but we wouldn't be offering a choice if we expected the beginner students to do the 'challenge' problems.  We'd rather that a student skips it (and perhaps come back to it later) then get so frustrated that they quit the course entirely.","",""

I think one reason you've had difficulty is because you had thought you had to do all the checks at the prompt, but you have to actually do 3 checks total, and once you break the problem into these 3 checks and solve each check individually, it becomes easier.
And as curiouskiwi says, why don't you skip this for now, you can always come back to it later,  maybe in just a week or two you can easily solve this, right now you don't know enough of the syntax and you're new to these concepts, but once you know more, it will be much easier to solve these problems.","",""

But I really think they should maybe word this pset a little differently.

My code for this part is: 

 for (int i = len-1; i >=0; i = i-2)
    {
        printf(""Digit is %c.\n"", str[i]);
        sum_digits1 = sum_digits1 + (str[i]-'0');

        int lastdigit = input % 10; //takes input and modulos it, getting last digit and setting equal to temp

I had a look and my main suggestion would be to test whether or not the card has a valid checksum before figuring out which card it might be.  You know that if the checksum is invalid (ie, if (algo2 % 10 != 0) you can then simply print INVALID and return 0 so the program ends.  That way, if the program hasn't ended, you can then go on to check for each card, but again, just print the result and return 0.  This saves you having to check all the possible cards, store that in a variable, and then do that if/if else/ if else / else construct.   ( I tried to reply privately but you've blocked me?)","",""

bool AMEX = (cardNum / 10000000000000 == 34 || cardNum / 10000000000000 == 37) && (digitCount == 15);

@ragah_d for my code the problem is it bypasses the check for MASTERCARD where 51 >= n <= 55 so INVALID is printed. Similar with the AMEX check.

"697430017344536647","yfabulous#1891","15-Apr-20 04:22 PM","Hello everyone, 
I got a question regarding this exercise.

I've managed to do the checksum in a very ""ugly"" way :
assigning every other number to a variable, then make the sum of them.
The problem (if it is one), is that I got a couple line of code per variable,
which makes it long and not so pretty, it doesn't look like a ""good code"".

So I made a ""for"" loop to automatically isolate every other number, multiply per 2, and making the sum of each digit of that number and assign it to a variable.
I can print each of these number every time the loop finished, so far it works well.

What I can't get my head around is how to make the sum of all these numbers. I would need to sort of store a number at the loop's end, that would be fed to the loop again at each loop's start.

I feel we haven't yet been taught how to do it, 
but I'm probably wrong.

If anyone has an idea.","",""

Apart from the math, we've learned all this, but it becomes really long and need to assign a lot of different variables.

That's why I was searching for a sleeker way, and when I looked online I've heard about arrays, which again don't seem this hard but which we haven't covered yet.

 Unfortunately have met a problem that I can't seem to overcome. When trying to get the first and second digit of the card number, it will come back as either 0 or the calculation takes too long so that it times out. Looking for answers online I seem to be using the same repeated /=10 method that has worked for others. 

I will attach my admittedly clunky code 

any help much appreciated!

||#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h> 

long creditcard, start;
int digit, cs1 = 0, cs2 = 0, temp, cs3 = 0, cs4, temp2;

int main(void)
{
    do //input for credit card number
    {
    creditcard = get_long("" Number: "");
    } 
    while (creditcard < 1);

    do // checksum, split it into three parts cs1, cs2, cs3
    {

        cs3 = cs3 + (creditcard % 10);
        creditcard /= 10;
        cs1 = cs1 + ((creditcard % 10) * 2);
        temp = ((creditcard % 10) * 2);

                if (temp >= 10)
                {
                cs2 = cs2 + (temp % 10); 
                temp /= 10;
                cs2 = cs2 + temp;
                }
                else 
                cs2 = cs2 + temp;

After initializing checksum to 0, I also saw your algorithm isn't including the very last number, so for 40063..., it's not adding 4*2 to the sum.  Otherwise, that's one amazing formula.  I never thought of doing it like that!","",""

In english, you're saying this would translate to ""it cant be 13 AND it cant be 15 AND it cant be 16""

`if (counter != 13 || counter != 15 || counter != 16)`
So in english, this would translate to ""it can not be 13 OR it cant not be 15 OR it cant not be 16""

The thing is, to me the AND would see to be saying ""it can't be all of them at once"" and the OR would say ""it can't be any single one of these"" (Which is what I would expect I would want).
How am I misunderstanding OR combined with != here?

For example, if x is not 13 or 15, print ""invalid"". to me this seems correct... so I can't understand why and would replace this","",""

Previous exercises were simple, however now I would like to add several conditions to the while part of the loop, depending on if the number entered is 13, 15, or 16 digits long. I'm afraid I may be overcomplicating things and would appreciate a comment or two. Is this approach overly complicated? If not, my remaining questions are about the syntactic requirements for setting up multiple while conditions.

Here's the start of what I've written, trying to find if a number is positive AND less than 14 digits:

||long CCnum;
    do
    {
        CCnum = get_long(""What's your credit card number?: "");

Now, m using another for loop but here i want to use the original value of ccn i.e. 4300, not updated value i.e. 0. How can i achieve this?
Also, i will needing original value of ccn later also.","",""

@Inverted_Pyramid no I can't reuse original value, i had to store if another variable so my original value is safe","",""
