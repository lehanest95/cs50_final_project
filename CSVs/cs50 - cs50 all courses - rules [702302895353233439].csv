*tldr; Be kind, be helpful, be considerate, don't overshare*

**Civility**:  Constructive criticism and disagreements are welcome, but all discussions here should be civil, kind, and thoughtful.

 **Code** :  When asking a question about your own code, take care not to post too many lines, lest it spoil the problem for classmates. Best to post just a few lines (behind a spoiler tag) or privately share all of it with a classmate who offers to help (and who's already submitted that problem).

 **Other Courses**:  Posts that appear to be seeking answers to other courses' homework questions aren't allowed!

 **Promotions**:  Afraid links appearing to promote companies or individuals aren't allowed!

 **Solutions**:  Per the course's policy on academic honesty (https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/syllabus/#academic-honesty), take care not to share outright solutions to problems!
