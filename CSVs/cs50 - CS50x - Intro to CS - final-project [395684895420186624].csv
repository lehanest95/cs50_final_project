This is why I am GUI python, Tkinter got me interested... .. like VB.NET + MSSQL was a beautiful thing.  I almost can't believe it is declining in use.  You do your gui like old What you see is what you get web editors, It writes a ridiculous amounts of code to make the GUI and then gee you just have to double click a button on the GUI and write the action function, unlike tkinter and other packages which i like but, all the same python makes a window with little coding effort like VB.NET which if you look at the code its only windows and an absurd amount of code that is auto-generated for you.  
Then within that you get to write your simple function.  So, @curiouskiwi...","",""

Trying to deploy a Web App to Heroku and everything works well, except the app doesn't save the Session ID very well (least that is my guess.) The current LOGIN IDs can view a few pages before it forces you to re-LOGIN, but newly created users barely ever get past the index page.

For New Users, my guess is because I'm running SQLite which Heroku advises against, which I'm trying work around by implementing Heroku's suggested PostgreSQL (which I've never worked with before) but that doesn't resolve why I have to keep logging in on users that are already established. Thoughts would be great! (I'm running the same Login Required wrapper and code we used with Finance and it works perfectly fine locally.)

Font size is a bit small in the video (for watching on my phone). Voice sounds fine, as an ESL learner, I somewhat rely on people not having a thick accent.

App... Does not look half as complex as the GTD workflow as I remember it (>10a between reading the book and now). But I guess a final project does not have to match a feature list others implement to have their bills payed. I think the different areas of the app could be more visually different. Again, looks great for a final project of an ""introduction"" course.

My main issue is that this increases the pressure on me not to write another variation of ""To-Do List"" for the final project, I am lacking ideas that really resonate.","",""

The browser in the background performs the request, and when it is done, enqueues your callback function to be run whenever there's time. So your multiple callback functions don't run immediately, and they don't necessarily run in right order. All three callback functions will push to the same `scriptpart`, and will push it to `scriptlines`, that's why you have 3x same array with content of all three files.
You could use callbacks to handle this (e.g. count the open/completed requests and have the last to complete trigger further action), more modern would be to use jQuery's ""Deferred""s or the new standard Promise, possibly with async/await. But asynchronous programming is a challenging concept. But it's the only way to handle the limitation that JavaScript only ever runs one code at the same time. Setting the GET request to synchronous (that's possible) would pause the whole page, maybe the window, or the whole browser, until completion.","",""

Is is ok to use the cs50 python library (for example, the sql part) in the final project? Or it's best to try to use another technology?
I'm new to development and I'm struggling to do my final project because I'm trying to use what I see people calling ""more professional frameworks."" I've tried to do it with Django and Postgres, but sincerely I'm feeling a little stupid because I struggle even with the setup.

So my new ""idea"" was to start the final project as Finance, and putting it all down, but using some of the code in it, and doing the project itself. That means I would have to use CS50's library, and Flask, and SQLLite. Is there any problem with that? Thank you in advance.","",""

In your for row in rows, for the delete button, add a property so  <td style=""..."" key={value of the unique key in your database for that line}> Delete </td>
in your successful delete, call delete FROM table WHERE uniqueKeyColumn=this.key
That this.key term is where I am unsure.  In any case, you need to supply information of which database line corresponds to the rendered line, either through adding a prop, or reading the innerHTML of one of the other columns, or something like that.

At a guess, it's probably better practice to add a property to the <tr>?  But adding it to delete button complements your current code better.

I've stumbled across a problem using sqlite3 in Visual Studio Code. Essentially in Pset8 we had ""import cs50"" at the top of the application.py file. This allowed us to use keyword arguments when manipulating the database. An example from my finance, application.py is here: 

`# Record a log of the transaction`
            `db.execute(""""""INSERT INTO history(user_id, symbol_id, stock_change, cash_change)`
                                    `VALUES (:user_id, :symbol, :stock_change, :cash_change)"""""",`
                                    `user_id=session[""user_id""],`
                                    `symbol=lookup(request.form.get(""symbol""))[""symbol""],`
                                    `stock_change=int(request.form.get(""shares"")),`
                                    `cash_change=cost)`

In my final project I am trying to INSERT INTO my database, but I keep being told that `.execute() doesn't take keyword arguments`. The keyword arguments e.g. `cash_change=cost` are allowed in the pset8 finance project because we import cs50 at the top I want to be able to code in Visual Studio Code with sqlite3 (as I'll continue doing this after the course) and I don't want to rely on the cs50 library. 

I've tried *so many* different ways of formatting it in my Visual Studio Code file, but every time I run it, the `print(counter, word)` line works, but the table returns no data when I `SELECT * FROM words;` 

Does anyone here have insight on how to take off the CS50 training wheels and make this INSERT INTO command work? Happy to share more of my code if that helps.","",""

Yesterday since the announcement was made that restaurants and terraces can open soon, but reservations and control conversations are obligatory, I had the idea to make a central website that could manage both. 
This website would need to have the following functionalities:
- A register and login for both restaurant-owners and customers
- A page where restaurant owners can add info, a link to their own site, and max number of customers
- A general page where customers can look through all the available terraces, with a counter for the amount of reservations already made, with max 30. 
- A page where customers can make a reservation, and before being able to do so. a  page where they have to make an online statement, questionnaire about not having had any symptoms  
- A database in sql that keeps track of reservations and restaurants 
The main use of the website would be that it could help to distribute customers evenly by the way it orders the restaurants on the main page, and there could be a central form for a control conversation (approved by regulators) so that restaurant owners don't have to do that themselves. 
I would like to use JavaScript, HTML and CSS and find someone who has affinity with design in CSS and someone who is capable of managing databases in SQL.  Do reach out to me if you would like to collaborate.","",""
