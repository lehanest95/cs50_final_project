I’m in a career change to programming. I’ve attended a French program which I quit after a year.
– “There are pointers in C, and pointers are dangerous, so we’ll stop learning C and move on to Java, which is a better language.”
– “Text editors are not considered professional tools. You should avoid them. Use IDE instead. Eclipse is a great one.”

The game features an upgraded gun with a different looks and burst along with a new ballistic missile threat when the player manages to survive for a certain period.

Any advice? I would really appreciate it and i'll put your name in the credit page! :D

"198816801402912768","ToddTheSquid#2166","12-May-20 10:58 AM","So I recently watched a video about a computer science paradox. Figured the people here could answer a question I had about it maybe?

Basically take a theoretical program that analyzes the code of any other program and decides whether that code will stop at some point, or loop infinitely. It outputs a yes if it stops or a no if it loops (called HALTS). Take another program that, if it gets a ""yes"" as input, it loops infinitely, and if it gets a ""no"", it stops (called OPPOSITE). Then combine those into a single program and feed its code into itself. The paradox says it can't be done because if it stops, it'd loop, but if it loops, it'd stop, and thus the initial program can't exist.

But here's my thoughts on it:

 I genuinely don't see the paradox here. I don't see why saying ""HALTS(OPPOSITE,OPPOSITE)"" won't work means that ""HALTS"" can't exist. Wouldn't that just mean that it would need more information, a larger input, of say ""HALTS(OPPOSITE,OPPOSITE,OPPOSITE,OPPOSITE,...,I)"" to theoretical infinity since the result of ""OPPOSITE"" is dependant on the input? Or even just stopping at an arbitrary point and adding the input? It's not that the program doesn't work, it's that you've fed it an incomplete input. That's user error, no fault of the program.

Basically, you can't determine the result of a program without first knowing its input. That's all this ""paradox"" says to me. Doesn't seem like a paradox at all to me, just faulty logic on the part of whoever thought it up (IIRC it was Turing who thought it up)","",""
