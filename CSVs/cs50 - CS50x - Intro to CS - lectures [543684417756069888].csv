"188847683841032194","Midge#3751","09-Feb-19 07:06 PM","@Hun I think this is a sufficient explanation for someone first starting:
`pass by value` means you only give the function a value (with a certain type, of course, e.g., Int)
`passing by reference` means giving the function the actual place in memory the argument is kept (see: pointer)

so `a` remains `10` not because of ""curly braces"", but because it was passed by value to `set_int`, thus when `set_int` ran, all it did was create a copy of `a` and changed said copy's value","",""

But to respond to what you said, I'm unsure about this because I found your description hard to follow, but it seems you have this part confused: `main` calls `set_int` with an argument (given as a value) and expects ""nothing"" returned (hence `void`), not the other way around.
Following from that, the starting `x` value that `set_int` has is of course what `main` passes as an argument, 10. However, `x` is not the same `int` as `a` in that it is a copy being used for `set_int`. Thus `a` was passed by value, not reference, and so while `x` may be changed, `a` remains unchanged.","","üëå (1)"

1)Ensure that when you AJAX request is completed the ready state is 4
2) the status code receive have to be 200 OK

So, If I understand, I can use JavaScript in such in a way that when I click on a section of the page, the browser make a AJAX resquest, which have a series of states.

When the process have finish, we have to get to the state 4 and the response of the data receive has to be 200 OK if that so,the browser will reload a section of the page. Am I right??","",""

I'm studying lesson 2, and in the binary0 example there is the code line (line 28): ""right = sizeof (book) / sizeof (string) - 1;""

I printed the screen:
1. sizeof (book) = 72 but when I recalculate each element in the array book []  by using strlen () for each name in the book [] list, only 55?

2. sizeof (string) I understand that the function will return the number of bytes of the variable (in this case the string variable), but in the example there is no string variable. And I also searched the web but there is no information about using the sizeof function to return the number of bytes for the string type.

"234679095378706433","Blauelf#6622","04-May-19 11:24 PM","I don't know the lectures, but I guess you are talking about a `for` loop with a `let`-type variable, similar to
```js
for (let i = 1; i < 5; i++) {
    setTimeout(function() {
        console.log(i); // different result with let or var in the for loop
    }, i * 100);
}
```
There's a few things in that.
Functions can access variables of outer scopes. Even if the function that scope belongs to has returned, they retain a connection to the variable, and not its value at function definition time.
`var` variables have function scope. No matter where in a function it's declared, it is valid for the whole function.
`let` variables are block scope, they exist only within the scope (and there's the TDZ, but that's another topic). `let` in `for` loops is a bit special, though: It's rebound per iteration, initialized to the value of the previous variable. So a function expression within the loop will have its own private variable that will not be changed in further iterations.

About the same could be achieved using IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions), you will find them especially in a lot of pre-ES6 code.","",""

"234679095378706433","Blauelf#6622","16-Jun-19 11:05 AM","As we know the function `compare_strings` is returning `true`, we could add `== true`, but there is no need for that. If it's meant to return a boolean value, we can use it directly in a condition.
In C, boolean is not a built-in type. Instead, anything that's 0 is interpreted as false, and anythin non-zero is true. `true` is just one somewhat arbitrary non-zero value, and many functions even specify to return a value of zero or non-zero, not referring to `true` at all.
I could iterate strings, like
```c
    char *str = ""Hello"";
    for (int i = 0; str[i]; i++) // loop will stop at null terminator '\0'
        putchar(str[i]);
    putchar('\n');
```
I could iterate linked lists (you will meet them in week 4, I guess)
```c
    for (node *cursor = root; cursor; cursor = cursor->next) // loop will stop at NULL pointer
        printf(""%i\n"", cursor->data);
```
In all those cases, the condition is tested for being non-zero, doesn't require the condition to be `true`. It's often more readable to add a `!= '\0'`, or `!= NULL`, or `!= 0`. All those three would not add any bytecode, as equality is tested by subtracting both sides and see whether the result is zero, and here we can optimize away the subtraction of zero.","",""

So if we open with an editor an image file or an executable you get some mambo jambo characters because it's a compiled file. do we literally copy those characters into another file which we save as .jpg or executable and it works?

So a char* doesn't actually know where that string ends, it just gives the address of that first char. But then, when David compares char *s and char *t, how do they come out being ""same"".... it's because his compare char-by-char for-loop also consists of the strlen condition, right?

So there always has to be something that checks where the string ends, otherwise a char * will point to an address, and whatever comes after that, infinitely?

1. Pretty sure i solved the first problem by doing ```pip (or pip3) install psycopg2-binary``` after installing setuptools and six
2. Make sure you've run ```export DATABASE_URL=(your key)``` (this will reset on terminal quit)
3. In your py file, use ```os.getenv(""DATABASE_URL"")``` instead of checking your key itself
4. You might want to have ```from tempfile import mkdtemp
app.config[""SESSION_FILE_DIR""] = mkdtemp()``` in your file to create a temporary directory to store user sessions in. Might not be totally necessary, but i saw Brian Yu do it in his CS50 Beyond lectures.

Then he explains that linked lists can't be accessed randomly because they are not stored in memory in a sequential order. I'm wondering.. can we not create and maintain simultaneously an array where we store the linked list's nodes in a serial way?

`bool` is defined in `stdbool.h`, which is a standard library included in `cs50.h` (so we get it indirectly). C has no native boolean types, it usually differentiates between zero and non-zero. `false` is `0`, and `true` is `1`, but some functions usually treated as returning a boolean value (formally returning an `int`) return various non-zero values (which might provide additional information). For example, you could use `if (strcmp(str1, str2)) { printf(""Different!\n""); }`, ignoring that it actually returns a positive or negative value telling you the lexicographic order.","",""

Part of programming is being able to look at the documentation of an API or a library and be able to use that information in your own program.  So it is good practice for real life situations.  For example, just because you know JS or Python doesn't mean you can write a Discord bot. You still need to go look through their API

So the base case is if you call `collatz(1)` then there are 0 steps (since you are already at 1).

If the number if even, then you add a step and then call collatz on (n/2).

If the number is odd, then you add a step and then call collatz on (3n + 1)

Let's say you call `collatz(12)`    The sequence is

`12 -> 6 -> 3 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1`

"665756333370245121","Franciscosta#2924","22-Jan-20 09:11 PM","(a) A float has a limited number of bits where a value can be stored. Out of the 32 bits, 9 are occupied by the sign and the exponent. 

(b) That leaves me with 23 bits for the actual result. 

(c) 1 divided by 10 is just like 10 divided by 3‚Ää-‚Ääboth imperfect, but the later is just more immediately explicit with the result being 3.3333‚Ä¶ whereas in the former it takes about 9 decimal houses to spot the imperfection 0.10000000149‚Ä¶ 

(d) In the case of 1 divided by 10, the float has 23 bits available to store the result. This means that its able to store up to 27 decimal houses of that particular number. From then on it no longer has enough bits to store the number. This means the result is rounded to its nearest storable number. 

(e) From that point forward the computer just returns zeros. These zeros are not stored in the float itself and are rather just an expression of [null]. 

(f) That's what overflow is: the float's lack of memory to store the result in its infinite precision.","",""

JavaScript itself cannot have the classic memory leak because it has automatic memory management (""garbage collection""), but you can definitely keep data in scope so it cannot be garbage collected. You can define functions anywhere in the code, and they have access to all the scopes outside, no simple resetting stack as in C, this causes a large number of variables to stay ""accessible"" and prevent them from garbage collection. It gets even more fun when adding DOM manipulation.

1. According to prior programming experience with C# I know that in most languages strings are immutable, and the way we get string as input in lecture 4 causes the string to be a normal char array, which is mutable, how do higher level languages get immutable string as input?

2. From what I understood, memory for variables within functions are allocated when the program starts (for example if I have an array in main), is that correct? If it is, how it memory for code like this allocated when the program starts if the code doesn't know what the user will input?
int x = get_int();
int arr[x];

3. When should I use malloc instead of just declaring an array?

}

for some reasn i don't seam to be albe to wrap my head around the function ""lenght""... 
in my brain it just apperas out of nowehre and isn't defined, so how does the program understand that with ""lenght"" it should refer to the Number ""n"" as promted by the User,

"393854278764068875","curiouskiwi#1671","10-Apr-20 06:06 AM","so `float average(int length, int array[])` declare a function called `average` that takes 2 arguments, an int and an int array.  When you call it from main with `average(n, scores)`  you are passing it the 2 arguments.  The value `length` will be the value of `n` and the  `array[]` will be the `scores` array.  Remember that a function is like a block box that simply takes argument(s) and returns a value.  What those arguments are called ""internally"" to the function doesn't really matter to the calling function, as long as it sends the right types of variables.","",""

@Blokchoy I think it's because we were passing copies of values to functions so that they could do their work on them, as opposed having functions change actual values at those addresses in memory.  The swap example is a great demo.  I would re-visit that part of the lecture and try to grasp what is happening there.   

When we use pointers, we are pointing to address in memory, and changing it in place.  Anybody else that can share why pointers would be used over normal operation, please add! thank you","",""
