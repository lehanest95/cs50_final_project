I don't think a password is more or less worth than a password hash used in its place. Client certs are a thing in theory, haven't met one so far.

Companies like cloudflare break the process, as they have to terminate the TLS connection.
Company firewalls also install themselves as man-in-the-middle, decrypting all the traffic and re-encrypting it on the other side. Because it's much safer if the firewall software reads your traffic first. Fun if it tries to unzip some exotic file and runs into some buffer overflow, then the safety measure might introduce a method for Remote Code Execution in the network.

(Example values (id= 1, person_id=5 , symbol= 'AAPL', quantity bought=5, quantity sold=0) -> meaning that user with id 5 bought 5 shares from AAPL.)
The purpose of this table is to store all the information of user transactions (buying or selling stocks)

I want to create another table 'hasshares' with the columns 'id', 'person_id', 'symbol'  ,'quantity'.  (Example in this case values (id=1, person_id=5, symbol='AAPL', quantity=5).
The purpose of hasshares is to display users who have a non-negative amount of shares of certain stock symbol (to know if he can sell them or not, too) .

Is it possible to make the table 'hasshares' to be connected with the table 'history' and updates itself, so i can only insert values into 'history' and after that, 'hasshares' automatically calculates, remaning shares for an user.

Example: user with id 5 buy 5 shares from apple. Then sells 2 shares from apple. (this data goes into 'history' table)

Password reset and recovery is available for when a user forgets his or her password. Flask-Security sends an email to the user with a link to a view which they can reset their password. Once the password is reset they are automatically logged in and can use the new password from then on.

> - you can still use ""application.py"" as your flask application file, however you must run `export FLASK_APP=application.py` for mac/linux or ` $env:FLASK_APP = ""application.py""` for windows (powershell), this also applies for the API key, you will need to use `$env:API_KEY = ""insert api key here""`
> - you might get some errors, make sure you have all the packages you are importing installed by using pip 
> - the latest version of werkzeug stopped supporting some functions used in this problemset so you might have to downgrade to 0.16.0 by using `pip install werkzeug==0.16.0`
